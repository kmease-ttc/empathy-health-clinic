```

### Hub-and-Spoke Model (Best Practice)

**Create Content Hubs Around Your Highest-Traffic Topics:**

1. **Anxiety Hub** (if "anxiety" is high-performing)
   - **Hub Page:** `/anxiety-treatment` (condition page - already exists!)
   - **Spoke Pages:**
     - `/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt` (therapy)
     - `/medication-management` (treatment)
     - Blog: "Managing Anxiety During Holidays"
     - Blog: "Anxiety vs. Panic Attacks"
   - **Strategy:** Link from hub to all spokes, and from each spoke back to hub

2. **Depression Hub** (if "depression treatment orlando" ranks well)
   - **Hub Page:** `/depression-treatment` (condition page)
   - **Spoke Pages:**
     - `/therapy-counseling` (treatment)
     - `/emdr-therapy` (therapy for trauma-related depression)
     - Insurance: `/blue-cross-blue-shield` (coverage for depression care)
     - Blog: "15 Best Jobs for People with Depression"

3. **Insurance Hub**
   - **Hub Page:** `/insurance` (overview page)
   - **Spoke Pages:** 12 individual insurance provider pages
   - **Cross-Link:** From treatment/therapy pages to relevant insurance pages
   - **Example:** "Covered by Aetna, Blue Cross, and Medicare. [Learn about your coverage](/insurance)"

### Internal Linking Checklist

## Step 3: Content Gaps (Create New Pages for "Almost Ranking" Keywords)

### How to Identify Content Gaps

1. **Export Search Console Queries:**
   - Go to Performance → Search Results → Queries tab
   - Filter: Position 11-30
   - Export to Google Sheets

2. **Look for Patterns:**
   - Questions: "how to...", "what is...", "can I..."
   - Locations: "orlando psychiatrist", "winter park therapy"
   - Insurance: "does blue cross cover therapy", "mental health coverage"
   - Demographics: "anxiety treatment for teens", "postpartum depression"

3. **Match Against Existing Content:**
   - ✅ Have a page? → Optimize it (add sections, update title)
   - ❌ No page? → Create dedicated landing page or blog post

### Example Content Gaps to Fill

Based on typical mental health searches in Orlando:

#### Likely High-Opportunity Keywords:
1. **"psychiatrist that takes [insurance] near me"**
   - Current: You have insurance pages
   - Gap: Add "Finding a Psychiatrist Near You" section to each insurance page
   - Gap: Create blog post "How to Find a Psychiatrist That Takes Your Insurance in Orlando"

2. **"online therapy orlando"** or **"telehealth mental health florida"**
   - Current: You have `/virtual-visit`
   - Action: Optimize that page with more keywords around teletherapy, online psychiatry
   - Action: Create blog post "Online vs. In-Person Therapy: Which is Right for You?"

3. **"mental health urgent care orlando"** or **"same day psychiatrist appointment"**
   - Current: Not addressed
   - Gap: Create landing page `/urgent-mental-health-care` or add section to homepage
   - Gap: Blog post "What to Do When You Need Mental Health Help Right Now"

4. **"couples therapy orlando"** or **"marriage counseling winter park"**
   - Current: May exist as therapy service
   - Action: Ensure dedicated page with local keywords
   - Action: Blog posts about relationship issues

5. **"child psychiatrist orlando"** or **"teen therapy winter park"**
   - Current: May be addressed in team bios
   - Gap: Create dedicated landing page "Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services"
   - Gap: Blog posts targeting parents

6. **"does insurance cover therapy"** variations
   - Current: Insurance pages exist
   - Gap: Comprehensive blog post "Complete Guide to Mental Health Insurance Coverage in Florida"

7. **Local + Condition combos** (e.g., "anxiety treatment winter park")
   - Current: Condition pages exist but may not emphasize local
   - Action: Add location-specific sections to condition pages
   - Action: Create location-specific blog posts
