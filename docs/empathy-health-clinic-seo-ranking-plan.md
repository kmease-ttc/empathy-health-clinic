# Empathy Health Clinic – SEO Ranking Plan for Top 250 Keywords

This document explains **how to rank for the 250 target keywords** without overbuilding, cannibalization, or compliance risk.

This is a **practical execution plan**, not theory.

---

## Core Principle (Read This First)

❌ You do **NOT** want 1 page per keyword.  
✅ You want **1 page per search intent**, with keywords grouped intelligently.

Google ranks **pages**, not keyword lists.

The goal is:
- Clear intent
- Strong topical authority
- Minimal overlap
- High trust (YMYL-safe)

---

## High-Level Page Architecture

You will rank for ~250 keywords using **~20–30 total pages**.

### Page Types Used

1. Core Clinic Pages  
2. Condition / Service Pages  
3. Location Pages  
4. Supporting Trust Pages (FAQs, Process, Approach)

---

## 1. Core Clinic Pages (5–6 Pages)

These establish authority and capture broad, high-volume terms.

### Required Pages

- /psychiatrist-orlando  
- /psychiatry-clinic-orlando  
- /adult-psychiatry  
- /telepsychiatry-florida  
- /medication-management  
- /new-patient-psychiatry  

### What These Pages Rank For

- psychiatrist orlando  
- psychiatry orlando  
- mental health clinic orlando  
- adult psychiatrist orlando  
- online psychiatrist florida  
- psychiatric medication management  

### Rules

- One primary keyword per page
- 8–15 secondary keywords naturally included
- No condition-specific deep dives here

---

## 2. Condition / Service Pages (12–15 Pages)

These are your **money pages**.

Each page owns a **keyword cluster**, not a single term.

### Required Pages

- /adult-adhd-treatment  
- /anxiety-treatment  
- /depression-treatment  
- /mood-disorders  
- /bipolar-disorder-treatment  
- /ptsd-trauma-treatment  
- /ocd-treatment  
- /executive-function-coaching  
- /burnout-stress-treatment  
- /neurodivergent-mental-health  

### What These Pages Rank For

Example: **Adult ADHD Page**

Ranks for:
- adult adhd psychiatrist orlando  
- adhd diagnosis adults  
- adhd evaluation orlando  
- non stimulant adhd treatment  
- adhd telehealth florida  

### Content Requirements (Per Page)

- 1,200–2,000 words
- Clear diagnostic + treatment framing
- Medication-responsible language
- Explicit adult-only positioning
- Internal links to:
  - Core clinic page
  - Location page
  - Intake page

---

## 3. Location Pages (3–5 Pages)

Location pages connect **intent + proximity**.

### Required Pages

- /orlando-psychiatrist  
- /winter-park-psychiatrist  
- /central-florida-psychiatry  

### What These Pages Rank For

- psychiatrist near me  
- psychiatrist winter park  
- mental health clinic near me  
- adult psychiatrist florida  

### Rules

- One location per page
- No keyword stuffing
- Reference services, not repeat them
- Embed map + NAP consistency

---

## 4. Keyword-to-Page Mapping Strategy

### Example: Anxiety Keywords

All of these map to **ONE page**:

- anxiety psychiatrist orlando  
- anxiety treatment orlando  
- panic disorder treatment  
- anxiety without benzodiazepines  
- long term anxiety treatment  

Mapped page:
- /anxiety-treatment

---

## 5. Internal Linking System (Critical)

Every page must link **up and sideways**.

### Required Links Per Page

- Link to 1 core clinic page
- Link to 1–2 related condition pages
- Link to 1 location page
- Link to intake / appointment page

This builds **topical authority + crawl clarity**.

---

## 6. FAQs = Long-Tail Keyword Capture

You do NOT create pages for:

- “safe anxiety medication management”
- “adhd care no benzos”
- “ethical psychiatry florida”

These live as **FAQ sections** on core pages.

Each FAQ:
- 50–80 words
- Schema-enabled
- Direct answer, no fluff

---

## 7. What NOT To Do (Very Important)

❌ No page per keyword  
❌ No thin blog posts  
❌ No city + condition spam pages  
❌ No benzo-related language  
❌ No duplicate condition pages  

This causes:
- Cannibalization
- Ranking suppression
- Trust loss

---

## 8. Execution Order (Do This In Order)

### Phase 1 – Foundation
- Core clinic pages
- Intake page
- Location pages

### Phase 2 – Revenue Pages
- ADHD
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Mood / PTSD / OCD

### Phase 3 – Authority Expansion
- Neurodivergence
- Burnout
- Executive function
- FAQs

---

## 9. Success Metrics (What Matters)

- Pages indexed cleanly
- One page per intent ranking
- Stable upward movement
- Local + organic visibility
- No keyword cannibalization

---

## Final Rule

If a new keyword appears, ask:

**“Does this fit an existing page’s intent?”**

- Yes → add content
- No → new page (rare)

That discipline is how you rank all 250 keywords without blowing up the site.
