# Topical Cluster Map

Purpose: Build topical authority by organizing content into pillar pages
and tightly interlinked clusters.

Rules: - Each core topic has 1 pillar page (2k--5k words) - Each pillar
has 5--20 supporting posts - Every cluster post links to pillar - Pillar
links to all cluster posts - No standalone content

Goal: Establish domain-level authority in each topic.
