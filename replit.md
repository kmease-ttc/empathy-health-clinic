# Empathy Health Clinic - Content Management System

## Overview
This project delivers a modern, fast Content Management System (CMS) and website for Empathy Health Clinic, replacing their existing WordPress/Elementor setup. The core purpose is to streamline content updates, enhance site performance, provide SEO-optimized landing pages for healthcare services and conditions, and offer a high-converting user experience. It aims to support comprehensive content management and improve online visibility and patient acquisition.

## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a React Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components for a professional healthcare design. It features a responsive layout with full dark mode support. Typography uses Inter font exclusively, loaded via modern Google Fonts API with preconnect optimization. Aggressive cross-linking is implemented across all content types to enhance user navigation and SEO. Trust factors are prominently displayed throughout the site, and lead capture forms are designed for high conversion.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query for data fetching, Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with an in-memory storage (MemStorage) for content. All API endpoints include Zod validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel (`/admin`) for managing site content, including treatments, therapies, conditions, team members, testimonials, insurance providers, blog posts, and leads.
- **Email Notifications:** SendGrid integration sends lead notification emails to specified recipients upon form submission.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO optimization including unique meta tags, structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness, Article schema), auto-generated XML sitemap, proper robots.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, mobile-first design, and image alt text.
- **Dynamic Content:** Real-time content updates are pulled from the API.
- **Blog System:** Complete blog with listing page (`/blog`) and individual post pages (`/blog/:slug`), featuring extensive SEO metadata, JSON-LD, related articles, author bios, and social sharing. Blog content from WordPress has been migrated, converted to Markdown, and enhanced with internal links and optimized imagery.
- **Analytics System:** Site health monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB), Google Analytics 4 integration, page view tracking, conversion event tracking, and an admin analytics dashboard at `/admin/analytics`.

### System Design Choices
The system uses an in-memory storage solution for simplified deployment, though this means data resets on server restarts. The project structure separates client, server, and shared concerns for modularity. Content types are rigorously defined to support detailed and SEO-rich pages.
