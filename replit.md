## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, featuring a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, and the Inter font. Key UI/UX decisions include aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors, and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Critical UX Fixes - Microsoft Clarity Analysis (November 10, 2025)

**1. Form Validation "Dead Click" - FIXED ✅**
- **Issue:** Multi-step form "Next" button appeared broken (silent validation failure)
- **User Impact:** Form abandonment, lost conversions
- **Fix:** Enhanced `LongContactForm.tsx` with toast notification, auto-scroll, and focus on error fields
- **Result:** Users receive immediate, clear feedback when validation fails

**2. Phone Link "Dead Click" on Therapy Pages - FIXED ✅**
- **Issue:** Phone number clicks failed to open dialer on Mobile Safari (Google Ads traffic)
- **Root Cause:** onClick handler on Button component created race condition
- **Fix:** Moved onClick from Button to anchor tag in `TherapyDetail2.tsx`
- **Result:** Phone links work reliably on mobile, preventing lost paid conversions

**3. Team Member "Dead Click" on Virtual Therapy - FIXED ✅**
- **Issue:** Provider names had hover effects but weren't clickable
- **User Impact:** Users couldn't research providers before booking
- **Fix:** Wrapped team member cards in Link components in `VirtualTherapy.tsx`
- **Result:** Users can now click providers to view full bios and credentials

**4. Duplicate Lead Notification - FIXED ✅**
- **Issue:** Duplicate submissions (within 5 minutes) returned silently without admin notification
- **User Impact:** Admins unaware when users resubmit forms (possible data loss scenario)
- **Fix:** Modified deduplication logic in `server/routes.ts` to send admin email even for duplicates
- **Technical:** Email subject includes "(DUPLICATE RESUBMISSION)" flag
- **Result:** Admin notified of ALL form submissions, including resubmissions

**5. SEO Content Expansion - COMPLETED ✅**
- **Goal:** Expand 38 pages from 50-112 words to 300+ words (Google SEO requirement)
- **Method:** OpenAI GPT-4o automated expansion with clinical accuracy
- **Results:** 
  - 9 treatments: 322-424 words
  - 15 therapies: 363-420 words  
  - 4 conditions: 485-518 words

- **Files Updated:** PhysicianSchema.tsx, OrganizationSchema.tsx, LocalBusinessSchema.tsx
- **Impact:** Resolved Schema.org validation errors, improves eligibility for Google rich snippets

**7. Dynamic Blog Redirect System - Google Search Console Fix - COMPLETED ✅**
- **Issue:** 21 URLs flagged as "Crawled - currently not indexed" in GSC (14 blog posts + 7 other pages)
- **Root Cause:** Legacy blog URLs (/{slug}) not redirecting to new canonical format (/blog/{slug})
- **Solution:** Implemented in-memory blog slug cache with O(1) lookup performance
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Boot-time cache initialization loads 180 blog slugs from database
  - Storage hooks (create/update/delete) keep cache synchronized with blog mutations
  - Callback pattern integrates blog slug checker into canonicalization middleware
  - Single-segment path guard prevents false matches on multi-segment URLs
  - Early-stage redirect handling (before route processing) for optimal SEO
- **Files Modified:** server/storage.ts, server/redirect-config.ts, server/routes.ts
- **Results:** All 21 problematic GSC URLs now redirect correctly (301 status)
  - 14 blog posts: /{slug} → /blog/{slug}
  - 7 other pages: treatments/therapy-treatment → /therapy, /hm05/ → /services, etc.
- **Impact:** Eliminates duplicate content penalties, consolidates SEO authority to canonical URLs

### Testing & QA

**Regression Test Plan Created:**
- Multi-step form submission flow
- Lead creation and database persistence
- Deduplication behavior verification

  - /blog/bipolar-psychosis-symptoms-treatment-recovery
  - /blog/petulant-bpd-symptoms-and-treatment
- **Root Cause:** BlogPosting schema included `aggregateRating` field, which is invalid per Schema.org standards
- **Fix:** Removed aggregateRating block from BlogDetailPage.tsx (lines 253-261)
- **Technical Details:**
  - BlogPosting schema doesn't support aggregateRating without Review wrapper
  - Google expected Review schema with itemReviewed field when seeing ratings
  - Rating data preserved in database for potential future Review schema implementation
- **Validation:** Automated Playwright test confirmed fix on 3 affected URLs:
  - All pages load successfully with valid BlogPosting structured data
