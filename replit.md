## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, featuring a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, and the Inter font. Key UI/UX decisions include aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors, and high-conversion lead capture forms.
