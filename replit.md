## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## SEO Automation Pipeline (November 2025)
Automated daily SEO workflow orchestrating GSC data, SERP tracking, tech audits, and task prioritization:

### Pipeline Components
- **main.py:** Fetches Google Search Console data and generates initial tasks.csv
- **step2_serp_update_tasks.py:** Checks live SERP rankings via Serper.dev API, enriches tasks with position data
- **step3_parse_sf_exports.py:** Parses Screaming Frog technical audit exports (internal_all.csv)
- **step4_merge_and_prioritize_simple.py:** Combines all data sources, calculates impact/effort scores, outputs tasks_final.csv
- **daily_seo_pipeline.py:** Full orchestration script with SendGrid email notifications

### Deployment Options
1. **Replit Scheduled Deployment:** Daily cron job (`0 7 * * *` = 2 AM EST) runs full pipeline
2. **Manual Execution:** Run `python3 daily_seo_pipeline.py` on-demand
3. **Continuous Integration:** Trigger via GitHub Actions or external scheduler

### Task Prioritization Algorithm
- **Impact Score:** Position-based opportunity (page 2+ = +5, page 1 bottom = +4) + tech issue severity (http-error = +6, performance issues = +2-3)
- **Effort Score:** create-landing = 3.0, supporting-blog = 2.0, improve-landing = 1.5, tech-fix = 1.5-2.5
- **Priority Score:** Impact - (0.8 × Effort)

### Autonomous Implementation System (November 2025)
**Fully autonomous SEO task executor** - The system automatically implements high-priority tasks without human intervention:

**Components:**

- **create-insurance-landing.ts:** AI-powered landing page creation (7 insurance providers)
- **optimize-landing.ts:** Page optimization based on SERP analysis
- **fix-tech-issues.ts:** Automated technical SEO fixes

**Safety Features:**
- Git checkpoint before changes (rollback capability)
- Auto-commit with descriptive messages
- Max 3 tasks/day limit (conservative)
- Priority threshold 2.0 (high-value only)
- Complete audit trail via git diff in email
- Dry run mode for testing

**Capabilities:**
- Creates insurance provider landing pages (Cigna, BCBS, UMR, Aetna, United, Medicare, Medicaid)
- Optimizes existing pages (titles, meta descriptions, content expansion)
- Fixes technical issues (missing meta tags, canonical tags, H1s)
- Verifies page existence before creating
- Skips tasks that can't be safely automated

**Workflow Integration:**
1. Daily pipeline generates prioritized tasks
2. Autonomous engine implements top 3 tasks
3. Git commit with changes
4. Email report with implementation summary and git diff
5. Rollback available via `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

### Email Reports
Daily summary emails via SendGrid to providers@empathyhealthclinic.com, kevin.mease@gmail.com containing:
- **Autonomous Implementation Results:** Tasks implemented, failed, skipped with full git diff and rollback instructions
- Top 10 priority tasks with scores, actions, SERP positions
- Tech issue flags (http-error, slow-mobile, thin-content, missing SEO elements)
- File generation status (tasks.csv, serp_ranks.csv, tech_audit.csv, tasks_final.csv)

### Cost
~$0.30/month (Serper.dev SERP checks $0.001/query × ~12 queries/day + OpenAI API for autonomous content generation ~$0.05/day)
