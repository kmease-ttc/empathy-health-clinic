## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. It features a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors, and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend Stack:** React SPA with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, and Wouter for routing.
- **Backend Stack:** Express.js REST API with hybrid storage (in-memory for content, PostgreSQL for analytics/leads) and Zod for validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel for various content types, including a comprehensive blog system with AI Blog Generation.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO implementation with unique meta tags, canonical tags, structured data, auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, strategic internal linking, real-time Google ranking tracking, competitor analysis, and an autonomous SEO task executor.
- **SEO Webhook Endpoint:** Automated SEO task implementation via `/api/seo/implement` webhook for executing landing page creation and optimization.
- **Analytics System:** PostgreSQL-backed analytics tracking Core Web Vitals, GA4, Facebook Pixel, Microsoft Clarity, page views, conversion events, and Google Ads conversions, with an admin dashboard.
- **Admin Dashboards:** Includes a Link & Performance Monitor, SEO Optimization Dashboard, Blog SEO Optimizer, and SEMrush Keyword Optimizer.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Mobile-first approach with code splitting, analytics deferral, resource hints, script optimization, and hero image preloading. Includes JavaScript optimization techniques like Gzip compression and dynamic script guards.
- **URL Management:** Unified canonicalization middleware for www removal, trailing slash normalization, content redirects, and query parameter stripping. Dynamic blog redirect system with SEO-safe slug normalization.
- **SEO Tag Optimization:** Enforced character limits and Title Case normalization for titles and meta descriptions. Meta keywords are limited and normalized with geo-specific terms. H1/H2 tags are centrally formatted, enforce character limits, Title Case, and include contextual suffixes to prevent keyword cannibalization.
- **Security Hardening:** YMYL-compliant security headers and rate limiting for form submissions and API endpoints.
- **Robots Directives & Indexing Control:** Comprehensive robots directive system via `SEOHead.tsx` noindex logic, X-Robots-Tag headers, and `robots.txt` rules. Includes pagination noindex and hreflang internationalization.
- **Structured Data Architecture:** Unified schema generation (`StructuredDataBuilder`) for Organization, LocalBusiness, Physician, FAQ, Article, Insurance, Breadcrumb, WebPage, MedicalWebPage, MedicalProcedure, MedicalTherapy, Review, and AggregateRating schemas, with duplicate prevention.
- **YMYL Content Audit Implementation:** Comprehensive YMYL compliance via reusable components for authoritative sources (citations to NIMH, APA, NIH), localized content, and contextual internal linking.

### Feature Specifications
- **Core Pages:** Comprehensive landing pages for services, insurance providers, psychiatric treatments, therapy services, and conditions, including Google Ads and city-specific landing pages.
- **Orlando Landing Pages:** Nine SEO-optimized Orlando-specific psychiatry landing pages with LocalBusiness/MedicalBusiness schema and strategic internal linking, targeting "Psychiatry Clinic in Orlando" as a primary goal.
- **High-Intent Landing Pages:** Optimized pages for high-volume keywords like "psychiatrist near me" and condition-specific searches (anxiety, depression) in Orlando, featuring above-the-fold forms and appointment messaging.
- **Treatment Landing Pages:** Dedicated pages for treatments like EMDR therapy and TMS treatment, detailing FAQs, evidence, and coverage.
- **Lead Capture:** High-converting forms with automated email notifications and backend deduplication.
- **Trust Factors:** Integration of HIPAA compliance and other credibility indicators.
- **Accessibility:** Mobile responsiveness and dark mode.
- **Redirect Management:** Comprehensive redirect configuration to resolve legacy URLs and soft 404 errors.

### System Design Choices
The system uses an in-memory storage solution for simplified deployment, with data resetting on server restarts. The project structure is modular, separating client, server, and shared concerns. Content types are rigorously defined to support detailed and SEO-rich pages. An automated SEO pipeline and an autonomous implementation system continuously optimize the site.
