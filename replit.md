# Empathy Health Clinic - Content Management System

## Overview
This project delivers a modern, fast Content Management System (CMS) and website for Empathy Health Clinic, replacing their existing WordPress/Elementor setup. The core purpose is to streamline content updates, enhance site performance, provide SEO-optimized landing pages for healthcare services and conditions, and offer a high-converting user experience. It aims to support comprehensive content management and improve online visibility and patient acquisition.

## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a React Single Page Application (SPA) built with TypeScript, utilizing Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components for a professional healthcare design. It features a responsive layout with full dark mode support. Typography uses Inter font exclusively, loaded via modern Google Fonts API with preconnect optimization. Aggressive cross-linking is implemented across all content types to enhance user navigation and SEO. Trust factors are prominently displayed throughout the site, and lead capture forms are designed for high conversion.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query for data fetching, Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with an in-memory storage (MemStorage) for content. All API endpoints include Zod validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel (`/admin`) for managing site content, including treatments, therapies, conditions, team members, testimonials, insurance providers, blog posts, and leads.
- **Email Notifications:** SendGrid integration sends lead notification emails to specified recipients upon form submission.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO optimization including unique meta tags, canonical tags pointing to preferred domain (https://empathyhealthclinic.com) across all pages, structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness, Article schema), auto-generated XML sitemap, proper robots.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, mobile-first design, and image alt text.
- **Dynamic Content:** Real-time content updates are pulled from the API.
- **Blog System:** Complete blog with listing page (`/blog`) and individual post pages (`/blog/:slug`), featuring extensive SEO metadata, JSON-LD, related articles, author bios, and social sharing. Blog content from WordPress has been migrated, converted to Markdown, and enhanced with internal links and optimized imagery.
- **Analytics System:** Site health monitoring with Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB), Google Analytics 4 integration, page view tracking, conversion event tracking, and an admin analytics dashboard at `/admin/analytics`.
- **SEO Optimization Dashboard:** Comprehensive SEO strategy tools at `/admin/seo` including Search Console integration guidance, content gap analysis for "almost ranking" keywords, internal linking recommendations using hub-and-spoke methodology, and actionable week-by-week implementation checklists. Complete SEO guide available at `SEO_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`.
