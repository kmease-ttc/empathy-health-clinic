## Overview
This project delivers a modern, high-performance CMS and website for Empathy Health Clinic.

The system supports SEO-optimized landing pages, comprehensive analytics, and automated SEO workflows to achieve these goals.

## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. It features a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, the Inter font, aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors, and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, and Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with hybrid storage (in-memory for content, PostgreSQL for analytics/leads) and Zod for validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel for various content types, including a comprehensive blog system with AI Blog Generation.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO implementation with unique meta tags, canonical tags, structured data, auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, and strategic internal linking. Includes real-time Google ranking tracking, competitor analysis, and an autonomous SEO task executor.
- **SEO Webhook Endpoint:** Automated SEO task implementation via `/api/seo/implement` webhook. Receives prioritized tasks from external schedulers and automatically executes landing page creation, optimization, and technical fixes using TypeScript scripts. Requires `SEO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for authentication.
- **Analytics System:** PostgreSQL-backed analytics tracking Core Web Vitals, GA4, Facebook Pixel, Microsoft Clarity, page views, conversion events, and Google Ads conversions, with a dedicated admin dashboard and Google Ads API integration.
- **Admin Dashboards:** Includes a Link & Performance Monitor, SEO Optimization Dashboard, Blog SEO Optimizer, and SEMrush Keyword Optimizer.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Mobile-first approach with code splitting, analytics deferral, resource hints, script optimization, and hero image preloading.
- **URL Management:** Unified canonicalization middleware for www removal, trailing slash normalization, content redirects, and comprehensive query parameter stripping (40+ tracking params). Dynamic blog redirect system with SEO-safe slug normalization.
- **Title & Meta Description Optimization (November 2025):** SEOHead.tsx now enforces: titles max 60 chars with Title Case normalization and automatic brand suffix; meta descriptions max 160 chars with 80-char minimum and YMYL-compliant fallback generation. Applied to document.title, og:title/description, twitter:title/description.
- **Meta Keywords Optimization (November 2025):** formatKeywords() enforces 3-7 keyword limit with: utility page suppression, canonical consolidation path exclusion, lowercase normalization, deduplication, and automatic backfilling. GEO_KEYWORD_MAP provides path-specific geo terms for 9 Central Florida locations (Orlando, Winter Park, Kissimmee, Altamonte Springs, Lake Mary, Sanford, Apopka, Maitland, Casselberry).
- **H1 Tag Optimization (November 2025):** Centralized H1 formatting via `formatH1()` in seoHelpers.ts. Enforces 20-70 char limits, Title Case with uppercase abbreviation preservation (FL, ADHD, CBT, etc.), pipe symbol replacement. LandingPageTemplate applies formatH1 to all hero titles. Orlando cluster H1s differentiated: "Psychiatrist Orlando", "ADHD Psychiatrist Orlando", "Bipolar Psychiatrist Orlando", etc. to prevent keyword cannibalization.
- **H2 Tag Optimization (November 2025):** Centralized H2 formatting via `formatH2()` in seoHelpers.ts. Enforces 25-70 char limits for ALL inputs, Title Case with uppercase abbreviation preservation (ADHD, CBT, TMS, EMDR, GAD, OCD, PTSD, etc.), generic heading prevention, and automatic contextual suffix addition (" in Orlando, FL" or " - Expert Care in Orlando, FL") for short headings. Includes recursion guards for safe fallback handling. LandingPageTemplate applies formatH2 to all H2 headings. Unique H2 maps defined for Orlando cluster, location, insurance, and condition pages to prevent cannibalization. Added validateH2() for validation and isGenericH2() for detection.
- **Security Hardening (November 2025):** YMYL-compliant security headers (X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, CSP, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy). Rate limiting: 10 requests/15min for form submissions, 100 requests/min for API endpoints. Enhanced structured data with medical qualifications, founder info, and isAcceptingNewPatients flags.

### Feature Specifications
- **Core Pages:** Comprehensive landing pages for services, insurance providers, psychiatric treatments, therapy services, and conditions, including Google Ads and city-specific landing pages.
- **Orlando Landing Pages:** Nine SEO-optimized Orlando-specific psychiatry landing pages with LocalBusiness/MedicalBusiness schema and strategic internal linking. Primary target: **/psychiatry-clinic-orlando** (exact H1 "Psychiatry Clinic in Orlando") for #1 ranking goal. Additional pages: /psychiatrist-orlando, /adhd-psychiatrist-orlando, /anxiety-psychiatrist-orlando, /child-psychiatrist-orlando, /bipolar-psychiatrist-orlando, /medication-management-orlando, /telepsychiatry-orlando, /same-day-psychiatrist-orlando. Internal linking: Homepage "Orlando Psychiatry Specialists" section and Footer "Orlando Psychiatry Services" band (both feature /psychiatry-clinic-orlando as first link with emphasized styling).
- **High-Intent Landing Pages:** **/psychiatrist-near-me** - Optimized for the #1 high-intent search term with above-the-fold contact form (not just CTA link), medication management emphasis, insurance badges, and same-week appointment messaging. Expected to increase conversion rate by 25-60% vs. generic therapy page routing.
- **Treatment Landing Pages:** **/emdr-therapy** - EMDR trauma treatment with detailed FAQs and evidence-based information. **/tms-treatment** - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for treatment-resistant depression, highlighting FDA approval, non-invasive nature, minimal side effects, and insurance coverage (November 2025).
- **Lead Capture:** High-converting forms with automated email notifications, backend deduplication, and email failure tracking.
- **Trust Factors:** Integration of HIPAA compliance and other credibility indicators.
- **Accessibility:** Mobile responsiveness and dark mode.
- **Redirect Management:** Comprehensive redirect configuration with 100+ mappings covering legacy WordPress URLs, duplicate content, therapy/location/insurance pages, and blog posts. All Soft 404 errors from Google Search Console resolved (November 2025).

### System Design Choices
The system uses an in-memory storage solution for simplified deployment, with data resetting on server restarts. The project structure is modular, separating client, server, and shared concerns. Content types are rigorously defined to support detailed and SEO-rich pages. An automated SEO pipeline and an autonomous implementation system continuously optimize the site.
