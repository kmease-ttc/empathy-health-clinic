## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## Recent Changes
### November 14, 2025
- **Mobile Contact Form Button Fix (Nov 14):** Fixed critical iOS Safari clickability issue where "Get Scheduled Today" button on contact forms appeared unresponsive (observed via Microsoft Clarity session recordings). Root cause: Global `StickyMobileCTA` component (fixed, z-50) was overlapping contact form submit button (sticky, z-20), causing users to unknowingly click "Request Appointment" instead of submitting forms. Fix: (1) Increased ShortContactForm button container z-index from 20 to 60 (now renders above global CTA), (2) Removed negative margins `-mx-6 -mb-6` that caused touch target issues in iOS Safari, (3) Added `min-h-11` (44px) to button for iOS touch target compliance, (4) Added iOS `safe-area-inset-bottom` padding via inline style. Automated testing confirms: form submits correctly to /api/leads, no unwanted navigation, proper z-index layering. Affects all pages using ShortContactForm component.
- **Desktop Homepage LCP Optimization (Nov 14):** Implemented critical Core Web Vitals optimizations to reduce desktop LCP from 2.5s to target sub-2.5s (estimated 2.1-2.3s). Changes: (1) Added `fetchpriority="high"` attribute to homepage hero image (HeroSection.tsx), (2) Coordinated head-level `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">` via SEOHead component reusing existing preload infrastructure, (3) Verified hero image optimized at 47KB WebP (well under 100KB target). Implementation preserves existing `loading="eager"`, `decoding="sync"`, and explicit dimension attributes. Expected: 200-400ms LCP reduction, improved Google Search Console Core Web Vitals validation, better user experience and SEO rankings.

### November 13, 2025
- **Automated Orlando Blog Publishing System (Nov 13):** Implemented secure automated daily blog publishing for 10 Orlando psychiatry SEO blog posts (800-1200 words each). Features include: (1) Database schema with status/scheduledPublishAt/publishedAt fields, (2) Secure REST API endpoint (/api/admin/publish-scheduled) with API key authentication and atomic UPDATE...RETURNING for race prevention, (3) Florida-themed Unsplash images for all posts, (4) Comprehensive SEO metadata (meta titles, descriptions, keywords), (5) Staggered publishing Nov 14-23 at 9 AM EST (one post/day), (6) Automatic sitemap regeneration after publish, (7) Public blog listing filters to exclude draft/scheduled posts. Security: Enforces BLOG_PUBLISHER_SECRET, fails fast if missing. Automation via external scheduler (cron-job.org/UptimeRobot recommended) or node-cron script. Expected: improved Orlando keyword coverage and SEO rankings.
- **Orlando Psychiatry SEO Optimization (Nov 13):** Implemented patient-centered content updates and Orlando-specific SEO across key pages. Updated /psychiatrist-orlando intro with empathetic tone ("when you're struggling with your mental health, finding the right psychiatrist matters"). Added Orlando SEO sentences with internal links to Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and OCD condition pages linking to /psychiatrist-orlando. Added comprehensive @graph JSON-LD schema with WebSite, MedicalOrganization, WebPage, and FAQPage types for enhanced search visibility. Internal linking already exists via Home page "Orlando Psychiatry Specialists" section (8 CTA cards) and Footer "Orlando Psychiatry Services" band (2×4 grid). All changes preserve SEO structure, schema, and keywords while improving patient-centeredness. Expected: improved Orlando keyword rankings and user engagement metrics.
- **Google Ads Tracking:** Added gclid/fbclid columns to leads table, updated forms to submit click IDs, deployed parameter preservation script to maintain UTM/GCLID across navigation
- **Blog Post Links:** Added external source links to ACLS blog (BLS, University of California, ACLSNow) plus internal service links
- **Google Search Console Fixes:** Fixed 128+ total errors including 85+ "Page with redirect" errors, 42 Soft 404 errors, and 1 canonical tag issue (varicose-veins blog post redirect)
- **Services Page Layout:** Fixed hero section vertical overlap between description and HeroLeadForm by implementing flex column with space-y-8/10 spacing
- **Blog Performance Optimization:** Implemented responsive image loading (640w/1024w/1200w), reduced quality (70-75 vs 80), intelligent preloading with srcset hints. Expected: LCP 6.1s → 3.5-4.5s, 70% smaller mobile payload, Performance Score 53 → 65-75

## SEO Automation Pipeline (November 2025)
Automated daily SEO workflow orchestrating GSC data, SERP tracking, tech audits, and task prioritization:

### Pipeline Components
- **main.py:** Fetches Google Search Console data and generates initial tasks.csv
- **step2_serp_update_tasks.py:** Checks live SERP rankings via Serper.dev API, enriches tasks with position data
- **step3_parse_sf_exports.py:** Parses Screaming Frog technical audit exports (internal_all.csv)
- **step4_merge_and_prioritize_simple.py:** Combines all data sources, calculates impact/effort scores, outputs tasks_final.csv
- **daily_seo_pipeline.py:** Full orchestration script with SendGrid email notifications

### Deployment Options
1. **Replit Scheduled Deployment:** Daily cron job (`0 7 * * *` = 2 AM EST) runs full pipeline
2. **Manual Execution:** Run `python3 daily_seo_pipeline.py` on-demand
3. **Continuous Integration:** Trigger via GitHub Actions or external scheduler

### Task Prioritization Algorithm
- **Impact Score:** Position-based opportunity (page 2+ = +5, page 1 bottom = +4) + tech issue severity (http-error = +6, performance issues = +2-3)
- **Effort Score:** create-landing = 3.0, supporting-blog = 2.0, improve-landing = 1.5, tech-fix = 1.5-2.5
- **Priority Score:** Impact - (0.8 × Effort)

### Autonomous Implementation System (November 2025)
**Fully autonomous SEO task executor** - The system automatically implements high-priority tasks without human intervention:

**Components:**

- Auto-commit with descriptive messages
- Max 3 tasks/day limit (conservative)
- Priority threshold 2.0 (high-value only)

- Optimizes existing pages (titles, meta descriptions, content expansion)
- Fixes technical issues (missing meta tags, canonical tags, H1s)
- Verifies page existence before creating
- Skips tasks that can't be safely automated

**Workflow Integration:**
1. Daily pipeline generates prioritized tasks
2. Autonomous engine implements top 3 tasks
3. Git commit with changes
4. Email report with implementation summary and git diff
5. Rollback available via `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
