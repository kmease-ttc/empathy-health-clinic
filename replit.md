# Empathy Health Clinic - Content Management System

## Project Overview

A modern, fast website with a content management system for Empathy Health Clinic, replacing WordPress/Elementor with a lightweight Replit-based solution.

## Architecture

**Frontend:**
- React SPA with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Wouter for routing
- Professional healthcare design with light/dark mode

**Backend:**
- Express.js REST API
- In-memory storage (MemStorage)
- Zod validation on all endpoints
- Full CRUD operations for all content types

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Beautiful landing page with all sections
- ✅ Admin panel at `/admin` for editing all content
- ✅ Real-time content updates from API
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Dark mode support

## Content Structure

The CMS manages the following content types:

1. **Site Content** - Hero section, footer info, about text
2. **Services** - Treatment services with icons and descriptions
3. **Team Members** - Staff profiles with photos and credentials
4. **Testimonials** - Patient reviews with ratings
5. **Insurance Providers** - Accepted insurance companies
6. **Conditions** - Mental health conditions treated

## How to Edit Your Website

### Access Admin Panel

1. Navigate to your site
2. Click "Admin" in the header (or visit `/admin`)
3. Use the tabs to edit different sections

### Adding Insurance Provider Logos

Your insurance logos from WordPress need to be uploaded to this project:

1. **Download from WordPress:**
   - Log into your WordPress admin
   - Go to Media Library
   - Download each insurance logo (BCBS, Aetna, Cigna, etc.)

2. **Upload to Replit:**
   - In this project, create folder: `attached_assets/insurance/`
   - Upload your logo files there
   - Recommended naming: `bcbs-logo.png`, `aetna-logo.png`, etc.

3. **Update Admin Panel:**
   - Go to `/admin` → Insurance tab
   - Click "Edit" on each provider
   - Update "Logo Path" to match your uploaded files
   - Example: `/attached_assets/insurance/bcbs-logo.png`

Until you upload the logos, the insurance section will display provider names as text.

### Edit Content

**Site Content Tab:**
- Edit hero title, subtitle, and hero image path
- Update review count and rating text
- Change footer contact information
- Modify about text

**Services Tab:**
- Add, edit, or delete treatment services
- Change service titles, descriptions, and icons
- Reorder services with the order field

**Team Tab:**
- Add/remove team members
- Update names, credentials, and image paths
- Reorder team member display

**Testimonials Tab:**
- Add new patient reviews
- Edit existing testimonials
- Set ratings (1-5 stars)
- Reorder testimonials

**Insurance Tab:**
- Add or remove insurance providers
- Reorder provider display

**Conditions Tab:**

### Important Notes

- **Changes are instant** - Content updates immediately upon saving
- **No database setup needed** - Uses in-memory storage (resets on server restart)
- **Image paths** - Currently using placeholder image paths from `attached_assets/`
- To use custom images, you'll need to add them to the project and reference their paths

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`:

- `GET /api/site-content` - Get site content
- `PUT /api/site-content` - Update site content
- `GET /api/services` - List all services
- `POST /api/services` - Create service
- `PUT /api/services/:id` - Update service
