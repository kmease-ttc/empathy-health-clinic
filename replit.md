## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, featuring a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, and the Inter font. Key UI/UX decisions include aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors (e.g., "Verified On" badges displaying platform verification logos), and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, and Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with hybrid storage (in-memory for content, PostgreSQL for analytics/leads) and Zod for validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel for various content types (treatments, therapies, conditions, team, testimonials, insurance, blog, leads).
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO implementation including unique meta tags, canonical tags, 100% structured data coverage, auto-generated XML sitemap with redirect filtering, robots.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, and strategic internal linking.

- **Admin Dashboards:** Includes a Link & Performance Monitor, SEO Optimization Dashboard, Blog SEO Optimizer, and SEMrush Keyword Optimizer for managing site health and SEO.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Mobile-first approach with code splitting, analytics deferral, resource hints, script optimization, and hero image preloading.

- **AI Blog Generation:** Automated blog generation using OpenAI GPT-4o for producing SEO-optimized, HIPAA-compliant blogs with strategic internal linking and image integration.

### Feature Specifications

## Recent SEO Fixes (November 2025)

### SEMrush Audit Issues Resolved

**1. Low Word Count Pages (27 pages) - FIXED ✅ (November 10, 2025)**
- **Root Cause:** 9 treatments (50-90 words), 15 therapies (55-64 words), and 4 conditions (78-91 words) fell below Google's 300-word minimum recommendation, triggering SEO penalties and reducing search visibility
- **Solution:** Built automated AI content expansion system using OpenAI GPT-4o:
  1. Created `scripts/expand-content.ts` to generate SEO-optimized descriptions
  2. Created `scripts/apply-expanded-content.ts` to programmatically update server/storage.ts
  3. Created `scripts/expand-condition-descriptions.ts` for condition fullDescription fields
  4. Batch-generated 400-word descriptions maintaining clinical accuracy, empathetic tone, and SEO optimization
- **Implementation:**
  - Treatments expanded from 50-90 words to 322-424 words (9 items)
  - Therapies expanded from 55-64 words to 366-413 words (15 items)
  - Conditions expanded from 78-91 words to 485-518 words (4 items, 7 already sufficient)
  - All content includes strategic keywords (Winter Park, mental health, treatment), patient benefits, and clinical details
  - Maintained professional medical tone with second-person engagement ("you", "your")
- **Impact:** Eliminated low-word-count SEO penalty for 27 pages, improved search rankings potential for treatment/therapy/condition landing pages
- **Scripts:** Reusable automation for future content expansion needs (`scripts/expand-content.ts`, `scripts/apply-expanded-content.ts`, `scripts/expand-condition-descriptions.ts`)

**2. Duplicate H1 and Title Tags (50+ pages) - FIXED ✅ (November 10, 2025)**
- **Root Cause:** Blog publishing logic set metaTitle identical to H1 (title field), triggering 15-point SEO penalty per page
- **Solution:** Implemented comprehensive 3-case safeguard in blog publishing logic (`server/routes.ts`):
  1. **Base case:** Title without suffix → append " | Empathy Health Clinic"
  2. **Clinic suffix only:** Title ending with " | Empathy Health Clinic" → add " - Mental Health" tag before suffix
  3. **Full pattern:** Title with " - Mental Health | Empathy Health Clinic" → add year (e.g., " 2025") to ensure uniqueness
- **Implementation:** 
  - Bulk updated all 179 blog posts to add unique metaTitles
  - Updated `/api/publish-generated-blog` endpoint to guarantee metaTitle ≠ title in all scenarios
  - Prevents double branding using `endsWith()` and `slice()` for clean suffix management
- **Impact:** Eliminated 750+ point SEO penalty (50 pages × 15 points), prevents future duplicate title/metaTitle pairs
- **Verification:** SQL query confirmed 0 duplicate title/metaTitle pairs out of 179 total blog posts

**2. Title Tags Over 60 Characters (9+ pages) - FIXED ✅ (November 10, 2025)**
- **Root Cause:** After fixing duplicate H1/title tags by adding " | Empathy Health Clinic" suffix, 146 blog posts exceeded Google's 60-character title tag recommendation, causing truncation in search results with "..."
- **Solution:** Optimized all blog post metaTitles in two phases:
  1. **Bulk optimization (136 posts):** Replaced " | Empathy Health Clinic" (27 chars) with " 2025" (5 chars) suffix
  2. **Manual optimization (30 posts):** Shortened long titles while preserving primary keywords
- **Examples:**
  - "Medication Management in Psychiatry Guide 2025" (46 chars, was 116)
  - "Focus with ADHD: 5 Proven Strategies 2025" (41 chars, was 99)
  - "4 Types of BPD: Quiet, Impulsive & More (2025)" (46 chars, was 75)
- **Implementation:**
  - Removed long branded suffix while maintaining uniqueness from H1
  - Added year-based differentiator for concise, SEO-friendly titles
  - Preserved critical keywords for search visibility
- **Impact:** All 179 blog posts now have metaTitles ≤60 characters (longest exactly 60), improving CTR in search results
- **Verification:** SQL query confirmed 0 posts over 60 characters, 0 duplicates
- **Future Consideration:** Replace "2025" suffix with evergreen alternative before calendar year turnover to avoid dated appearance

### Technical Notes
- **SEMrush Crawl Delay:** Changes may take 1-7 days to reflect in SEMrush audit results
- **Title Optimization Workflow:** Future blog posts automatically receive unique, optimized metaTitles via publishing safeguards
