# Empathy Health Clinic - Content Management System

## Overview
This project delivers a modern, high-performance CMS and website for Empathy Health Clinic. Its primary goals are to streamline content management, enhance site performance, provide SEO-optimized landing pages for healthcare services and conditions, and offer a high-converting user experience to improve online visibility and patient acquisition.

## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI for a professional healthcare design, featuring full dark mode support and Inter font. It emphasizes aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors, and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, Wouter.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with hybrid storage: in-memory (MemStorage) for content, PostgreSQL for analytics/leads, and Zod validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel (`/admin`) for diverse content types (treatments, therapies, conditions, team, testimonials, insurance, blog, leads).
- **Email Notifications:** SendGrid integration for lead notification emails.
- **SEO Features:** Unique meta tags, canonical tags, structured data (Organization/LocalBusiness, Article schema), auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, mobile-first design, image alt text.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Embedded map on homepage showing clinic location with address, hours, contact info, and directions link for improved local SEO and user experience. Footer map conditionally hidden on `/request-appointment` page to prevent duplicate display.
- **Dynamic Content:** Real-time content updates from the API.
- **Blog System:** Comprehensive blog with listing (`/blog`) and individual post pages (`/blog/:slug`), including SEO metadata, JSON-LD, related articles, author bios, and social sharing. Features hybrid organization with 2 featured posts, 9 latest articles (non-featured), and paginated archive with category filtering (Anxiety, Depression). Category filters don't trigger page scroll; only pagination scrolls to top.
- **Analytics System:** PostgreSQL-backed analytics with Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB), Google Analytics 4, Facebook Pixel tracking, page view tracking, conversion event tracking, Google Ads conversion tracking (phone clicks & form submissions), Google Ads API integration for paid vs organic attribution with auto-refresh 3x daily (every 8 hours), and an admin analytics dashboard (`/admin/analytics`). Phone call tracking includes automatic event capture when users click phone links on the website, plus a manual "+ Add Phone Call" button in the analytics dashboard for logging calls from external sources (e.g., Google Ads call conversions).
- **SEO Optimization Dashboard:** Strategic SEO tools at `/admin/seo` with Search Console guidance, content gap analysis, internal linking recommendations, and actionable checklists.
- **Performance Optimizations (Mobile-First):**
  - **Code Splitting:** All pages (except Home) lazy-loaded with React.lazy() and Suspense boundaries to reduce initial bundle size
  - **Analytics Deferral:** GA4, web-vitals, and UTM tracking load via requestIdleCallback with 2s timeout (Safari fallback: 1.5s setTimeout)
  - **Resource Hints:** dns-prefetch and preconnect for Google Fonts, Google Maps, GTM, and Ahrefs for faster external resource loading
  - **Script Optimization:** Ahrefs analytics deferred instead of async to prevent parser blocking
  - **Hero Image Preload:** Critical hero image preloaded with fetchpriority="high" for optimal LCP
- **URL Redirects:** 301 permanent redirects configured in `server/index.ts`:
  - **www to non-www redirect:** Preserves 100% domain authority after domain change
  - **Old WordPress blog URLs:** Redirects broken backlinks to preserve SEO value:
    - `/blog/finding-comfort-self-care-tips-for-those-who-are-grieving/` → grief counseling post
    - `/understanding-4-types-of-bpd/` → comprehensive BPD types guide
    - `/narcissistic-behavior-in-a-relationship/` → narcissistic relationships recovery guide
