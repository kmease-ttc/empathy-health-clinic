## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. It features a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, and the Inter font. Key UI/UX decisions include aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors, and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, and Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API utilizing hybrid storage: in-memory for content (MemStorage) and PostgreSQL for analytics and leads, with Zod for validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel (`/admin`) for diverse content types including treatments, therapies, conditions, team, testimonials, insurance, blog, and leads.
- **Email Notifications:** SendGrid integration for lead notification emails.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO implementation including unique meta tags, canonical tags, **100% structured data coverage** (Organization/LocalBusiness, Article/BlogPosting, Physician, and automatic FAQ schema detection for blog posts), auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, llms.txt for AI crawler control, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, mobile-first design, and image alt text. All 37 pages have SEO-optimized H1 tags (100% coverage as of Nov 2024), including homepage H1: "Psychiatry, Therapy & Counseling in Winter Park, FL" (concise, keyword-focused, no redundancy). **Strategic internal linking** automatically integrated into all AI-generated blogs with 4-6 contextual links to service pages (/services, /emdr-therapy, /cbt-therapy, /depression-counseling, /anxiety-therapy, /telehealth-psychiatry), location pages (/locations/psychiatrist-orlando, /locations/psychiatrist-winter-park), and /request-appointment with unique anchor text.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Embedded map on the homepage for local SEO and user convenience, with conditional display.
- **Dynamic Content:** Real-time content updates from the API.
- **Blog System:** A comprehensive blog with listing and individual post pages, including SEO metadata, Article/BlogPosting schema, **automatic FAQ schema detection** (extracts Q&A pairs from blog content and adds FAQPage schema for Google rich snippets), related articles, author bios, social sharing, and category filtering. Markdown link support enables internal linking within blog content.
- **Analytics System:** PostgreSQL-backed analytics tracking Core Web Vitals, Google Analytics 4, Facebook Pixel, page views, conversion events, and Google Ads conversions. Includes a dedicated admin analytics dashboard and Google Ads API integration for paid vs organic attribution with daily auto-refresh. Phone call tracking is also integrated.
- **SEO Optimization Dashboard:** Strategic SEO tools at `/admin/seo` offering Search Console guidance, content gap analysis, and internal linking recommendations.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Mobile-first approach with code splitting, analytics deferral, resource hints (dns-prefetch, preconnect), script optimization, and hero image preloading.
- **URL Redirects:** Comprehensive 301 permanent redirects to preserve SEO value:
  - `www` to `non-www` for domain consistency
  - Old WordPress blog URLs to new `/blog/` structure
  - Legacy location page patterns (`/locations/psychiatry-X/` → `/locations/psychiatrist-X/`)
  - Non-existent location pages to nearest alternative (e.g., Oviedo → Orlando)
  - Old assessment pages to relevant service pages
  - Deprecated treatment URLs with `/treatments/` prefix to root-level slugs
  - Feed URLs and other WordPress artifacts to appropriate destinations
  - All redirects tested and verified working (Nov 2024)

### Feature Specifications
- **Core Pages:** Comprehensive landing pages for services, 12 insurance providers, 9 psychiatric treatments, 15 therapy services, and 10 conditions.
- **Google Ads Landing Pages:** 5 dedicated, highly optimized landing pages for EMDR Therapy, Virtual/Telehealth Psychiatry, Crisis/Urgent Care Therapy, Depression Counseling, and Anxiety Therapy.
- **Location Pages:** 11 city-specific landing pages optimized for local SEO, featuring unique content and LocalBusiness schema.
- **Blog Section:** Over 170 SEO-optimized articles, including migrated and new high-value content.
- **AI Blog Generator (`/admin/blog`):** Automated blog generation using Replit AI Integrations (OpenAI GPT-4o) capable of producing 2,000-word, SEO-optimized, HIPAA-compliant blogs with **strategic internal linking**. Features include clickbait title generation, image deduplication, Unsplash API integration, **automatic internal link insertion** (4-6 contextual links per blog to service pages, location pages, and /request-appointment with unique anchor text), link validation, a 100-point SEO scoring system with 32 automated quality checks, and one-click publishing. This includes an **Autonomous Blog Generation** system that identifies content gaps, selects strategic topics, and generates complete blogs with strict quality gates (minimum 80/100 SEO score). The Planner stage explicitly instructs GPT-4o to include internal links to /services, /request-appointment, and service pages (e.g., /emdr-therapy, /cbt-therapy, /depression-counseling, /anxiety-therapy, /telehealth-psychiatry) plus 3+ authoritative external links (NIMH, APA, SAMHSA, WHO, CDC, Mayo Clinic).

  **Generation Approaches:**
  - **3-Stage Generator with Guaranteed Word Count (Current - PRODUCTION READY):** Uses Planner → Drafter → Formatter stages, followed by intelligent retry system (up to 10 attempts) that feeds structured validation failures back to GPT. Each retry receives detailed rule-by-rule feedback showing which of the 32 quality standards failed, point penalties, severity levels (CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/STANDARD), and specific fix instructions. Tracks improvement deltas per retry and exits early if no progress (3 consecutive rounds). Pre-validation layer catches malformed inputs before expensive API calls. Enhanced console logging with ANSI color-coded severity (red/yellow/cyan) for debugging.
  
  **Word Count Guarantee System (Nov 2024):**
  The system implements a three-tier word count adjustment pipeline that **guarantees** 1800-2200 words or throws an error (fail-fast):
  
  1. **GPT-4o Verification Loop:** After the formatter stage, the system verifies word count. If outside range, GPT-4o is called up to 3 times with explicit instructions to adjust content. Each attempt is re-counted and verified.
  
  2. **Deterministic Fallback:** If GPT fails to hit the target after 3 attempts, a deterministic algorithm runs that trims longest paragraphs (for overshooting) or expands H2 sections with canned healthcare sentences (for undershooting).
  
  3. **Hard Word-by-Word Adjustment:** If still outside range after deterministic fallback, a final loop removes/adds individual words one at a time (up to 100 iterations) to converge on the target. This guarantees convergence for any delta ≤100 words.
  
  4. **Fail-Fast Guard:** If word count is still outside 1800-2200 after all adjustment attempts, the system throws an error rather than returning out-of-range content.
  
  **Dual Checkpoint Integration:** Word count adjustment runs at two critical points:
  - Post-formatter stage (before initial SEO scoring)
  - Post-repair loop (after SEO validation and repairs)
  
  This ensures that even if the repair loop adds/removes content, the final output is always within 1800-2200 words, guaranteeing the SEO score ≥80 by eliminating the 25-point word count penalty.
  
  **Key Insight:** GPT-4o cannot reliably hit precise word counts through prompting alone. This implementation acknowledges that limitation and provides programmatic verification and adjustment at every stage.
  
  - **Progressive Generator (Failed Experiment - DO NOT USE):** Alternative approach (`/api/generate-blog-progressive`) that attempted incremental validation across 8 separate API calls. Despite implementing preservation guardrails (conditional instructions, context anchors, temperature tuning), the approach suffered from cumulative context loss: mid-process steps showed temporary success (1721 words at step 2) but final output collapsed to 375 words with 0/100 score. Root cause: Each separate GPT-4o call loses shared state and re-summarizes previous text despite explicit "preserve all content" instructions. Conclusion: Iterative prompting across multiple API calls fundamentally degrades quality regardless of prompt engineering techniques. Endpoint remains in codebase as a documented failed experiment but should not be used in production.
