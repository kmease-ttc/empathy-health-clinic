## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, featuring a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, and the Inter font. Key UI/UX decisions include aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors (e.g., "Verified On" badges displaying platform verification logos), and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, and Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with hybrid storage (in-memory for content, PostgreSQL for analytics/leads) and Zod for validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel for various content types (treatments, therapies, conditions, team, testimonials, insurance, blog, leads).
- **Email Notifications:** SendGrid integration for lead notification emails.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO implementation including unique meta tags, canonical tags, 100% structured data coverage (Organization/LocalBusiness, Article/BlogPosting, Physician, automatic FAQ schema detection), auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, llms.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, mobile-first design, image alt text, and strategic internal linking. Enhanced LocalBusiness schema with @type: ["MedicalClinic", "Psychiatrist"], complete social media profiles (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube), geo coordinates, and areaServed covering Winter Park, Orlando, Lake Mary, and Altamonte Springs for improved local SEO and "near me" search visibility. **Robots.txt Fix (Nov 2025):** Resolved SEMrush crawlability error by removing conflicting static robots.txt file with outdated WordPress paths. System now serves clean dynamic robots.txt via Express route that properly allows crawling while protecting admin panel and correctly references sitemap_index.xml.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Embedded map on the homepage for local SEO.
- **Blog System:** Comprehensive blog with listing and individual post pages, SEO metadata, Article/BlogPosting schema, automatic FAQ schema detection, related articles, author bios, social sharing, category filtering, and Markdown link support. Blog content rendering includes automatic HTML-to-markdown conversion and GPT artifact removal to ensure clean, professional display of AI-generated content. **Internal Linking (Dec 2024):** Comprehensive internal linking strategy implemented across ALL 176 blog posts (100% coverage) to address SEMrush's 503 missing internal link recommendations. Each post includes minimum 4 strategic internal links to key pages (/therapy, /services, /request-appointment, /team). High-priority posts feature contextual inline links; all posts include standardized "Professional Mental Health Support" resources section. This implementation reduces bounce rates and strengthens site-wide SEO through improved link equity distribution. **Content Formatting Improvements (Jan 2025):** Enhanced content formatting on 6 high-bounce-rate blog posts (what-is-love-bombing, prodromal-stage-mental-health, what-is-mental-breakdown, open-relationship-guide, signs-of-crippling-anxiety, understanding-social-exhaustion-adhd-brain) to reduce bounce rates. Improvements include: scannable bullet lists, shortened paragraphs, strategic mid-article CTAs, Quick Self-Check sections, better subheadings, and improved visual hierarchy—all using emoji-free formatting that complies with design guidelines.
- **Analytics System:** PostgreSQL-backed analytics tracking Core Web Vitals, GA4, Facebook Pixel, Microsoft Clarity (heatmaps & session recordings), page views, conversion events, and Google Ads conversions, with a dedicated admin dashboard and Google Ads API integration.
- **Link & Performance Monitor (`/admin/link-monitor`):** Comprehensive bounce rate tracking dashboard with Microsoft Clarity API integration (10 calls/day limit, 24-hour caching). Displays high bounce rate pages (70%+) and medium bounce rate pages (40-70%) with actionable recommendations. Includes graceful fallback to local analytics when Clarity API unavailable. Features per-endpoint cache isolation to prevent data corruption across different API surfaces.
- **SEO Optimization Dashboard:** Strategic SEO tools at `/admin/seo` for Search Console guidance, content gap analysis, and internal linking recommendations.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Mobile-first approach with code splitting, analytics deferral, resource hints, script optimization, and hero image preloading.
- **Email Deliverability:** SendGrid sender configuration with comprehensive DNS authentication guidance.
- **Google Indexing Strategy (Nov 2025):** Comprehensive action plan (GOOGLE_INDEXING_STRATEGY.md) created and IMPLEMENTED to address 67 unindexed URLs and 28 soft 404 errors. **Changes made:** (1) Fixed 28 soft 404 errors with 301 permanent redirects for old WordPress blog URLs, tag pages, author pages, date archives, and legacy location patterns; (2) Added "Specialized Therapy Services" section to homepage with 8-card grid linking to high-priority unindexed pages (CBT, anger management, PTSD, ESA letter, focus therapy, virtual counseling, in-person therapy); (3) Updated /services page to display ALL therapies instead of limiting to 6; (4) Added "Locations" section to footer with links to Winter Park, Altamonte Springs, Sanford, Orlando, and Lake Mary. Result: All 67 unindexed pages now have 2-5 internal links each from homepage, footer, and services page.
- **URL Redirects:** Comprehensive 301 permanent redirects for domain consistency, old WordPress URLs, legacy location patterns, and deprecated treatment URLs to preserve SEO value.
