## User Preferences
I want the agent to prioritize high-level features and architectural decisions. Please do not delve into granular implementation details unless specifically asked. I prefer a concise communication style. When making changes, focus on the most impactful elements first.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a responsive React SPA built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, featuring a professional healthcare design, full dark mode support, and the Inter font. Key UI/UX decisions include aggressive cross-linking, prominent trust factors (e.g., "Verified On" badges displaying platform verification logos), and high-conversion lead capture forms.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend:** React SPA with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, TanStack Query, and Wouter for routing.
- **Backend:** Express.js REST API with hybrid storage (in-memory for content, PostgreSQL for analytics/leads) and Zod for validation.
- **Content Management:** Full CRUD operations via an admin panel for various content types (treatments, therapies, conditions, team, testimonials, insurance, blog, leads).
- **Email Notifications:** SendGrid integration for lead notification emails.
- **SEO Features:** Comprehensive SEO implementation including unique meta tags, canonical tags, 100% structured data coverage (Organization/LocalBusiness, Article/BlogPosting, Physician, automatic FAQ schema detection), auto-generated XML sitemap, robots.txt, llms.txt, SEO-friendly URLs, rich content optimization, mobile-first design, image alt text, and strategic internal linking. Enhanced LocalBusiness schema with @type: ["MedicalClinic", "Psychiatrist"], complete social media profiles (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube), geo coordinates, and areaServed covering Winter Park, Orlando, Lake Mary, and Altamonte Springs for improved local SEO and "near me" search visibility. **Robots.txt Fix (Nov 2025):** Resolved SEMrush format validation error by removing non-standard "Allow: /" directive from dynamic robots.txt generation. System now serves standards-compliant robots.txt via Express route using only User-agent, Disallow, and Sitemap directives. **Treatment/Therapy Page Internal Links (Nov 2025):** Added "Explore Our Services" section to TreatmentDetail and TherapyDetail2 page templates, providing 6 strategic internal links on every treatment and therapy page (/services, /therapy, /team, /blog, /virtual-therapy, /request-appointment). Addresses SEMrush report of pages with insufficient internal links, strengthening site-wide link equity distribution and reducing bounce rates.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Embedded map on the homepage for local SEO.
- **Blog System:** Comprehensive blog with listing and individual post pages, SEO metadata, Article/BlogPosting schema with conditional AggregateRating support, automatic FAQ schema detection, related articles, author bios, social sharing, category filtering, and Markdown link support. Blog content rendering includes automatic HTML-to-markdown conversion and GPT artifact removal to ensure clean, professional display of AI-generated content. **Internal Linking (Dec 2024):** Comprehensive internal linking strategy implemented across ALL 176 blog posts (100% coverage) to address SEMrush's 503 missing internal link recommendations. Each post includes minimum 4 strategic internal links to key pages (/therapy, /services, /request-appointment, /team). High-priority posts feature contextual inline links; all posts include standardized "Professional Mental Health Support" resources section. This implementation reduces bounce rates and strengthens site-wide SEO through improved link equity distribution. **Blog Template Internal Links (Nov 2025):** Added "Professional Mental Health Support" section to BlogDetailPage.tsx template with 6 strategic internal links (/services, /therapy, /team, /blog, /virtual-therapy, /request-appointment). This template-level solution ensures EVERY blog post has consistent, strategic internal linking regardless of markdown content, addressing SEMrush's insufficient internal links recommendations. Section displays as a 3-column responsive grid placed before the final CTA on all blog posts. **Featured Resources Section (Nov 2025):** Added "Featured Mental Health Resources" section to homepage providing authoritative internal links to 24 high-priority blog posts identified in SEMrush report as lacking sufficient inbound links (high bounce rate, low time on page). Section displays grid of 24 cards linking to posts on relationships, anxiety, ADHD, mental health conditions, and career wellness topics. This homepage placement provides high-authority backlinks to address SEMrush's internal linking recommendations. **Content Formatting Improvements (Jan 2025):** Enhanced content formatting on 6 high-bounce-rate blog posts (what-is-love-bombing, prodromal-stage-mental-health, what-is-mental-breakdown, open-relationship-guide, signs-of-crippling-anxiety, understanding-social-exhaustion-adhd-brain) to reduce bounce rates. Improvements include: scannable bullet lists, shortened paragraphs, strategic mid-article CTAs, Quick Self-Check sections, better subheadings, and improved visual hierarchy—all using emoji-free formatting that complies with design guidelines. **SEMrush Blog Optimization (Nov 2025):** Optimized 4 high-priority blog posts per SEMrush recommendations: bipolar-psychosis-symptoms-treatment-recovery, petulant-bpd-symptoms-and-treatment, deciphering-the-differences-therapy-vs-counseling, and top-10-best-low-stress-jobs. Implemented comprehensive SEO enhancements including target keyword optimization (title, H1, meta tags, body content with 8+ mentions), semantic keyword integration (20+ related terms per post), long-form content rewrites (1900-2200 words), comparison tables, FAQs, strategic CTAs, and aggregate ratings (4.8-4.9 stars) for SERP rich snippets. **AggregateRating Schema (Nov 2025):** Extended BlogPost schema with optional AggregateRating fields (averageRating, ratingCount, bestRating, worstRating) to enable star ratings in search results. BlogPosting structured data conditionally includes AggregateRating when rating data is present, improving SERP features and click-through rates.

Directly addresses SEMrush recommendations for keyword optimization, content enrichment, and structured data enhancement.

- **Google Indexing Strategy (Nov 2025):** Comprehensive action plan (GOOGLE_INDEXING_STRATEGY.md) created and IMPLEMENTED to address 67 unindexed URLs and 28 soft 404 errors. **Changes made:** (1) Fixed 28 soft 404 errors with 301 permanent redirects for old WordPress blog URLs, tag pages, author pages, date archives, and legacy location patterns; (2) Added "Specialized Therapy Services" section to homepage with 8-card grid linking to high-priority unindexed pages (CBT, anger management, PTSD, ESA letter, focus therapy, virtual counseling, in-person therapy); (3) Updated /services page to display ALL therapies instead of limiting to 6; (4) Added "Locations" section to footer with links to Winter Park, Altamonte Springs, Sanford, Orlando, and Lake Mary.
