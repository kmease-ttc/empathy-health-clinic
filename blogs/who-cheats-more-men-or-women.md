**Who cheats more, men or women?** Cheating in relationships sparks countless debates. While there’s no absolute answer, it’s important to understand the psychology behind infidelity to better grasp the issue.

This article explores **why people cheat**, **how society plays a role**, and **why trust is key in relationships**.

At [Empathy Health](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/), we understand how vital healthy relationships are for your mental well-being. We provide resources and tips to help you navigate infidelity and build stronger connections.

Our goal isn’t to blame or use stereotypes, but to help you understand cheating better.
## What Is Cheating?

Cheating, or infidelity, is a breach of trust in a committed relationship where one partner becomes romantically or emotionally involved with someone outside the partnership. This can include physical affairs, emotional affairs, online interactions, or even excessive flirting.

Cheating can happen in two ways: **physical** or **emotional**.

 	- **Physical cheating:** Involves a romantic or sexual relationship with another person.

 	- **Emotional cheating:** Forms a close emotional bond with someone else that harms the main relationship.


It’s important to note that definitions of cheating vary depending on relationship agreements. For example, in an [open relationship](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/open-relationship-guide/) or polyamorous setup, boundaries around cheating are based on the specific agreements made between partners.
### Physical Cheating

Physical cheating involves sexual or intimate physical acts with someone outside the relationship. This includes actions like kissing, cuddling, or having sex. Even gestures like holding hands in a romantic way can be considered cheating if they cross boundaries set within the relationship.
### When Trust is Broken: Understanding Emotional Cheating

Sarah thought it was just another ordinary day. She grabbed her husband Mark’s phone to check something quickly, no big deal. But then, she saw a message from "Emily."

Curious, she tapped it. What she found hit her like a punch to the stomach. Late-night chats, flirty conversations, this wasn’t just friendship.

**Her heart raced.** *Was this real?*

*Tears filled her eyes. Her hands shook.*

“Mark,” she said, holding up the phone. He froze. After a long, difficult talk, Mark admitted it was an emotional affair. Sarah felt anger, sadness, and betrayal. Could she ever trust him again?

Mark promised to fix things. *“I’ll do whatever it takes.”* But Sarah wasn’t sure. Could their love survive this? Or was this the end?

Emotional cheating is often overlooked, but it can be just as damaging as physical infidelity. Trust can be broken in many ways.
## Why Do People Cheat?

That’s a tricky question. Unlike solving 1+1=2, there’s no simple answer. Infidelity doesn’t have a one-size-fits-all explanation, but research offers some insights.

Studies from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/) show that **20-25% of people in committed relationships admit to cheating** at some point. So, why does it happen?
### Emotional Reasons


 	- **Low satisfaction in the relationship:** Feeling unfulfilled can drive people to seek connection elsewhere.

 	- **Lack of communication:** Emotional neglect can lead to seeking closeness with someone outside the relationship.

 	- **Seeking validation:** People who feel ignored may look for attention and appreciation from others.

 	- **Revenge or resentment:** Unresolved anger can lead to “payback” cheating.


### Personal Reasons


 	- **Personal insecurities:** Low self-esteem or past trauma can influence infidelity.

 	- **Struggles with commitment:** Fear of exclusivity or long-term commitment can lead to cheating as a form of avoidance.

 	- **Desire for novelty:** A longing for excitement and new experiences.

 	- **Lowered inhibitions:** Alcohol and substances can impair judgment, leading to impulsive infidelity.


### Situational Reasons


 	- **Opportunity meets temptation:** Some cheat because they believe they won’t get caught.

 	- **Growing apart:** Emotional distance due to stress or life changes may push individuals to seek connection elsewhere.


### Why Is This Important?

Cheating breaks trust, causes emotional pain, and can even trigger anxiety or depression. Understanding why people cheat helps us address problems early and build stronger relationships.

## Are Men or Women More Likely to Cheat?

It’s a common myth that one gender cheats more than the other. Studies show that cheating happens at comparable rates for both.

For example, a [Link Springer study](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-38971-9_310-1) found that 23% of men and 19% of women reported extramarital sex. Similarly, a survey by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy shows that 15% of married women and 25% of married men admitted to affairs. While slightly different, these numbers highlight that infidelity isn’t exclusive to one gender.

Motivations differ, men may be driven by physical attraction or opportunity, while women often cite emotional dissatisfaction or a need for connection. But the core issues, trust, communication, unmet needs, are universal.
## The Psychology of Gender Infidelity

**“They say men are more likely to cheat.”** But is that true?

Rather than focusing solely on who cheats more, it’s more revealing to explore *why* infidelity occurs.
### Why Men Cheat


 	- **Lack of Physical Intimacy:** Feeling disconnected physically.

 	- **Seeking Novelty:** Looking for new experiences.

 	- **Boosting Self-Esteem:** Cheating as a way to feel appreciated.

 	- **Avoiding Relationship Problems:** Cheating to escape unresolved issues.

 	- **Emotional Distance:** Feeling disconnected emotionally.


### Why Women Cheat


 	- **Emotional Dissatisfaction:** Feeling emotionally neglected.

 	- **Seeking Emotional Connection:** Pursuing intimacy outside the relationship.

 	- **Revenge:** Retaliating for a partner’s betrayal.

 	- **Personal Fulfillment:** Seeking freedom or validation.



### Common Factors for Both


 	- **Lack of Communication:** Unspoken needs can lead to infidelity.

 	- **Unresolved Conflict:** Lingering issues create emotional distance.

 	- **Opportunity:** Situational factors can increase temptation.

 	- **Substance Abuse:** Impaired judgment fuels impulsive decisions.

## Do Societal Factors Play a Role?

Cheating is not just a personal choice; societal expectations play a big role. Traditional gender norms often excuse men’s infidelity while condemning women’s. But these outdated ideas are changing.
### Gender Roles, Changing Norms, and Inclusivity

More discussions are happening in [LGBTQIA2S+ communities](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/lgbtqia2s-identity-explained/), challenging stereotypes and focusing on mutual respect in all relationships.
### Attachment Styles and Infidelity


 	- **Secure Attachment:** Comfortable with trust and intimacy, less likely to cheat.

 	- **Anxious Attachment:** Fear of abandonment can lead to seeking attention elsewhere.

 	- **Avoidant Attachment:** Emotional detachment may drive cheating behaviors.


### Relationship Dynamics

Poor communication, lack of emotional connection, or unbalanced power dynamics often set the stage for infidelity. Couples who stop investing in their relationship are more prone to seeking fulfillment elsewhere.
## The Emotional Impact of Infidelity

Infidelity affects both partners deeply. The betrayed may feel anger, insecurity, and grief. The betrayer often feels guilt, confusion, and regret.
### Rebuilding Trust


 	- Open, honest communication.

 	- Mutual commitment to rebuild the relationship.

 	- Seeking professional therapy for deeper healing.


## How to Prevent Cheating


 	- **Open Communication:** Share needs and concerns regularly.

 	- **Establish Boundaries:** Define what infidelity means in your relationship.

 	- **Emotional Connection:** Spend quality time together.

 	- **Professional Support:** Counseling can help resolve recurring issues.


## Moving Forward After Infidelity

Healing is possible with time, effort, and support. [Couples therapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/couples-therapy/) and [intimacy therapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/therapy/intimacy-therapy-sexual-wellness/) can guide couples through the process of rebuilding trust and connection.
## Who Cheats More, Men or Women Doesn't Matter Anymore

The real question isn’t “who cheats more?” but “why does infidelity happen?” Understanding the deeper causes can lead to healthier, stronger relationships.
### Finding the Right Help

If infidelity has affected you, counseling is a powerful first step towards healing. Resources like the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) can connect you with licensed therapists who can help.
