## 5 Proven Strategies on How to Focus Better with ADHD
If you've ever found it challenging to finish a difficult job at work, studied for an important test, or worked on a challenging assignment, you may have wished you could Improve your Concentration and Focus. For individuals with ADHD, these challenges can feel even more overwhelming, as maintaining attention on a single task is often more difficult.

Concentration is the mental effort you put into whatever you're currently learning or working on. It is frequently confused with attention span, which concerns how long you can concentrate on anything. ADHD can cause shifts in both. [According to Cleaveland Clinic,](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4784-attention-deficithyperactivity-disorder-adhd) individuals with ADHD often find it harder to block out distractions, and factors like age or sleep deprivation can further affect focus.

As people age, they tend to forget things more quickly, and memory loss might be accompanied by decreased attention. 

Focus can also be impacted by ADHD, head or brain traumas (such as concussions), and other mental health conditions. When you're trying to focus but are having trouble, it can be stressful and frustrating, making it hard to concentrate on crucial work.

If this sounds like you, keep reading to learn more about scientifically supported strategies to improve concentration and focus, especially for those with ADHD.

### Meditation
Researchers from Harvard University discovered that 47% of the time, we are lost in contemplation. These thoughts are usually the result of students dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. For individuals with ADHD, this tendency to get lost in thought can be even more pronounced. Whereas worrying about the future can lead to tension and anxiety, reflecting on the past can produce feelings of melancholy and depression. Emotions become too much to handle if they are neglected.

You can overcome the never-ending "what could've been" and "what ifs" with meditation.

Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center claim that via relaxation, meditation can alter the structure and functionality of the brain.

Benefits of meditation include:

It Lessens melancholy, tension, and worry.Boost concentration and learning focus.Boost your attention span and memory.Boost your immune system and your level of psychological and physical resistance.Permit improved slumber.### Exercise
Any form of strenuous physical activity increases blood flow to the brain. It then activates your neurons, promoting the formation of new cells, particularly in the hippocampal area. For individuals with ADHD, even 20 minutes of physical activity before studying or working can significantly improve focus and concentration.

Exercise raises endorphin levels. This chemical reduces stress levels, which improves brain focus and concentration. ADHD makes people more susceptible to stress, and frequent exercise can help in managing that stress and maintaining a positive outlook.Frequent exercise will assist you in managing stress and maintaining a good outlook if you're feeling overwhelmed.Researchers found a connection between excellent academic focus and physical wellness. Prolonged periods of concentration benefit greatly from low-intensity exercise, which raises our energy levels. Studies have also shown that exercise boosts mental insight and creativity—perfect for someone with ADHD who might be looking for a motivational breakthrough.Now that you know how exercise boosts brain power, why not get moving and go for a run, jog, or walk?

### Sleep
A sleepless night might make you cranky the next day. Sleep deprivation can affect your emotions in the morning and your brain over time. You spend about one-third of your waking hours sleeping, so it's a necessary part of your daily routine. Like food and water, getting enough sleep at the proper intervals is essential for survival. 

Sleep is required to establish and maintain brain circuits that support learning and memory formation. It also makes it harder to focus and react quickly. Getting enough sleep can help with many conditions, so do your brain a favor and get the necessary ZZZs.

Sleep is essential for memory and learning. Not getting enough sleep makes it hard to focus and learn new things. Your brain does not have enough time to store memories properly for subsequent retrieval. Your brain can catch up as you sleep, preparing you for the next task.Lack of sleep saps your motivation and reduces your energy and time for muscle renewal. You'll experience slower reaction times and a more complex mental and physical effort. You perform at your best when you get enough sleep.Your brain is most likely to start processing memories while you are asleep. Your brain works to cement the memories you create during the day as you sleep.Even when your brain is entirely focused on falling asleep, it retains some degree of consciousness.## **Sleep and ADHD**
[ADHD can significantly affect sleep](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adult-adhd-and-sleep-problems). Many individuals with ADHD experience sleep disturbances such as difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early. 

Some common ways ADHD affects sleep include:

**1. Difficulty Falling Asleep (Sleep-Onset Insomnia)**

People with ADHD often have trouble winding down at night. Their minds may continue racing with thoughts, making it difficult to relax and fall asleep. Hyperactivity and impulsivity may also contribute to restlessness, preventing a smooth transition into sleep.

**2. Restless Sleep**

Individuals with ADHD might experience restless sleep, characterized by frequent waking, tossing and turning, or difficulty maintaining a deep, restful sleep. This can leave them feeling tired and unrefreshed in the morning, even after a full night in bed.

**3. Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder**

Many people with ADHD have delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, meaning their natural circadian rhythm is shifted later, causing them to feel more awake at night and struggle with early morning wake-ups. This can result in inconsistent sleep patterns.

**4. Increased Prevalence of Sleep Disorders**

ADHD is often linked with sleep disorders such as:

Sleep apnea: Obstructive sleep apnea, where breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep, can be more common in people with ADHD.Restless legs syndrome (RLS): Some individuals with ADHD report having an urge to move their legs at night, which can interfere with sleep.Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD): This condition causes involuntary movements of the limbs during sleep, leading to disrupted rest.5. Medication Side Effects

Stimulant medications, commonly prescribed for ADHD, can sometimes lead to sleep difficulties, particularly if taken later in the day. These medications can make it harder to fall asleep, despite improving focus during waking hours.

6. Impact on Sleep Hygiene

People with ADHD may struggle with maintaining good sleep hygiene practices, such as sticking to a consistent sleep schedule, limiting screen time before bed, or creating a relaxing bedtime routine, all of which are important for healthy sleep.

### How Sleep Problems Affect ADHD Symptoms
Lack of sleep can exacerbate core ADHD symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.Sleep deprivation worsens emotional regulation, memory, and cognitive function, making it harder to manage ADHD during the day.Improving sleep in individuals with ADHD often involves a combination of behavioral strategies, lifestyle adjustments, and, in some cases, medication under a healthcare provider's guidance. Prioritizing sleep can significantly improve ADHD symptoms and overall quality of life.

### Distraction-free environment
Your environment dramatically impacts your ability to concentrate. If there are many distractions around you, you'll need to focus more, so try to make your workspace as distraction-free as possible.

There are several methods to do this.

Shut down your messaging apps like Slack, Skype, and email. The relentless barrage of notifications from these applications will be annoying if you leave them open.To prevent becoming sidetracked by incoming calls or texts, mute your phone. Close the door to your office if you have one. It will shut out outside noise and let your colleagues know you are focused.If you don't have an office, avoid the noise by donning headphones and listening to music or other sounds.Turn off the TV if you are working from home.Clear your desk so that various people can handle it and not sidetrack you.## **Avoid multitasking**
Because multitasking requires mental energy to transition between tasks, it hinders concentration. Your brain finds it difficult to transition between tasks. A time interval known as the "switching cost" occurs each time you switch tasks since your brain has to pause working on one task and begin working on another. As a result, both tasks require much more time and are of lower quality.

The International Journal of Information Management reported on a study that found most people check their email every five minutes and that it takes them 64 seconds on average to get back to work after checking email. A great deal of time was wasted! Give your full, undivided attention to whatever you're doing. 

When you multitask, your brain cannot entirely focus on any job because it continuously switches back and forth.Single-tasking allows you to focus on the task at hand, relieving you of the cognitive strain and distractions of multitasking. When there is less constant switching between tasks, more energy may be put toward worthwhile endeavors. It's okay to focus again after every disruption.To improve your focus, stop multitasking and start single-tasking. 

Achieving better focus improves your quality of life in general. You can accomplish your most significant objectives more quickly by focusing on your most crucial duties. You're less scattered and anxious and can go on steadily with the things that matter most to you.

You feel better about yourself, have more robust connections, and are more productive.

If you are having trouble focusing, don't give up. You can strengthen your concentration muscles and succeed, even if it will take some time and effort!
