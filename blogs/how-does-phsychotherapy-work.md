Millions of people face mental health challenges that can affect their daily lives and overall happiness. Over [22.8% of U.S. adults](https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-by-the-numbers/) experienced mental illness in 2021. 
Psychotherapy is a valuable tool for treating mental health conditions like anxiety or depression. It helps improve quality of life by exploring and changing emotions and behaviors, leading to better coping skills and improved decision-making. 
But how does psychotherapy really work? Learn about the different [types of psychotherapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/therapy-treatment/) offered at Empathy Health Clinic and how we can help you achieve improved mental health.  
## What is Psychotherapy?

Psychotherapy is a collaborative process in which a therapist helps you explore your thoughts, behaviors and feelings to develop healthier coping mechanisms. Typically [done through talk therapy sessions](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies), psychotherapy provides a safe space to address issues affecting your mental health and well-being.
There are several types of psychotherapy, each suited to different mental health conditions and individual needs. They include:

 	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is one of the most widely used forms of psychotherapy. It focuses on [identifying and changing negative thought patterns](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral) and behaviors. This type of therapy is particularly effective for treating anxiety, depression and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). 
 	Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). DBT is a [cognitive behavioral therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2963469/) that helps you balance acceptance and change. It is beneficial for individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder and those who struggle with intense emotions and behaviors. 
 	Psychodynamic Therapy. This [type of therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64952/) explores how unconscious thoughts and past experiences influence current behavior. It aims to uncover deep-seated issues and resolve internal conflicts. 
 	Mindfulness-Based Therapy. This therapy [integrates mindfulness practices](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080597/) with cognitive techniques to help you focus on present experiences without judgment. It is effective in managing stress, anxiety and mood disorders. 
 	Group Therapy. In group therapy, multiple individuals with similar issues meet regularly to discuss their experiences under the guidance of a therapist. This type of therapy provides support and perspective from others facing similar challenges.

 
## How Does Psychotherapy Work?

The effectiveness of psychotherapy lies in the therapeutic relationship and the techniques used during therapy sessions. Here’s a closer look at how it works:

 	Building a therapeutic relationship. Feeling comfortable with your therapist is crucial for successful therapy. A strong therapeutic relationship based on trust and mutual respect allows you to openly discuss your thoughts and feelings. 
 	Assessment and treatment plan. During the initial sessions, the therapist will assess your mental health condition and discuss your goals for therapy. This can include [managing symptoms of anxiety](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/anxiety-treatment/), processing traumatic experiences related to PTSD or achieving healthier relationships with family members or romantic partners. Together, you will develop a tailored treatment plan that meets your needs and objectives. 
 	Exploring thoughts and feelings. During therapy sessions, you will explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviors. This process helps you gain insight into your emotions and behavior, identify negative patterns and understand how they impact your mental health. 
 	Developing coping strategies. A key goal of psychotherapy is to teach individuals effective ways to handle stress and emotions. Depending on the type of therapy, you might learn to recognize and reframe negative thoughts, use relaxation techniques like deep breathing or improve problem-solving abilities to boost emotional well-being. 
 	Ongoing support and adjustments. Psychotherapy is often a long-term process. As you progress, your therapist will provide ongoing support and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Regular sessions help reinforce positive changes and ensure continued progress.

 
## How Often Should I Attend Psychotherapy Appointments?

The frequency of psychotherapy appointments can vary depending on your needs and the issues you are addressing. When starting the process, you can expect weekly or bi-weekly sessions. 
This initial frequency helps establish a therapeutic relationship and momentum in addressing your concerns. However, the exact frequency can be adjusted based on the severity of your symptoms and how well you are progressing. 
We recommend attending sessions twice weekly at Empathy Health Clinic until your symptoms are well-managed. This more frequent schedule can provide increased support and accelerate progress, especially in the initial phases of treatment.
## Is Psychotherapy Done Online or In-Person?  

Psychotherapy can be conducted either online or in person. Both methods offer unique advantages based on your lifestyle, comfort and needs. The choice between these modalities often depends on personal preference and the specific therapeutic goals:

 	In-person psychotherapy. In-clinic therapy provides a direct, face-to-face interaction with your therapist, which can improve communication and build a stronger therapeutic alliance. This setting benefits those who find it easier to express themselves when physically present. 
 	Online psychotherapy. [Virtual therapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/virtual-visit/) offers greater flexibility and accessibility, making it ideal if you have a busy schedule, limited ability to travel or experience social anxiety. It allows for therapy sessions from the comfort of your home, ensuring continuity of care regardless of physical location.

Empathy Health Clinic recognizes the importance of accommodating individual preferences and circumstances by offering online and in-person psychotherapy options. This ensures that all clients can engage in therapy in a way that works best for them, helping maximize the effectiveness of their treatment.
