Bipolar disorder significantly affects mood, involving emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). Previously known as manic depression, it impacts about 1% of the global population. Gaining insight into bipolar disorder empowers affected individuals and their loved ones. This article discusses the disorder's types, symptoms, and diagnostic approaches.

####  
## Types of Bipolar Disorder
There are several distinct types of bipolar disorder:

- **Bipolar I Disorder:** This type features manic episodes lasting at least seven days or severe manic symptoms requiring hospital care. Depressive episodes usually occur as well, often lasting two weeks.
- **Bipolar II Disorder:** Here, milder hypomania episodes alternate with severe depression.
- **Cyclothymic Disorder (Cyclothymia):** This involves periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms over two years (or one year in children and adolescents). These symptoms, however, do not fully meet the criteria for hypomanic or depressive episodes.
- **Other Specified and Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorders:** This category includes symptoms that don't fully align with the above types.
