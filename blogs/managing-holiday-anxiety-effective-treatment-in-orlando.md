The combination of social obligations, financial pressures, and the general hustle and bustle can be overwhelming. Fortunately, there are evidence-based treatments that can help manage anxiety effectively during this busy time.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for anxiety. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. During the holidays, CBT can help you manage stress by teaching you to reframe negative thoughts about social gatherings or financial stressors.

CBT is often structured and goal-oriented, making it a practical choice for those looking to see improvements quickly. In Orlando, many therapists offer CBT, and it can be a valuable tool in your mental health toolkit.

### Medication Options

For some individuals, medication may be a necessary component of anxiety treatment. Common medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines. These medications can help reduce symptoms, making it easier to cope with holiday stressors.

It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best medication for your needs. They can provide guidance based on [authoritative treatment guidelines](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help) and your specific situation. Remember, medication is often most effective when combined with therapy and lifestyle changes.

### The Role of Lifestyle Changes

In addition to therapy and medication, lifestyle changes can play a significant role in managing anxiety. Here are some practical tips to consider during the holiday season:

  - **Exercise Regularly:** Physical activity can reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins. Consider a walk in one of Orlando's beautiful parks.

  - **Practice Mindfulness:** Techniques like meditation and deep breathing can help you stay grounded amidst holiday chaos.

  - **Maintain a Healthy Diet:** Eating well-balanced meals can stabilize your mood and energy levels.

  - **Set Boundaries:** It's okay to say no to events that feel overwhelming. Prioritize your mental health.
