You've probably heard the words “in person" a lot lately. But what does in person mean? Simply put, in person means being physically present in the same place as someone else. It's the opposite of virtual or online interactions.

When we talk about in person therapy, we mean meeting your therapist face-to-face in their office, rather than talking through a computer screen or phone.

The world changed a lot during the pandemic. Many people tried online therapy for the first time. Then suddenly, virtual meetings became the norm, and many people shifted to remote work, online learning, and telehealth visits.

While virtual sessions helped millions of people, many are now asking: "Should I go back to in person therapy?"

The answer isn't the same for everyone, but there are some clear benefits to meeting your therapist in person.
## What Is the Meaning of In Person?

In person means showing up physically, not through a screen, text, or phone call. It’s when you make the effort to go somewhere and be present face-to-face with someone. Going to a clinic in person is different from joining a virtual appointment. Meeting a friend at a café feels more real than chatting over video.

The in person meaning goes beyond just location, it’s about connection. Being physically present allows for deeper conversations, clearer communication, and a stronger human bond. In an in-person meeting, for example, people tend to feel more engaged, focused, and emotionally connected.

In therapy, that effort to show up in person can lead to more meaningful sessions, build trust more quickly, and provide real emotional support when it's needed most. If you're looking for in person synonyms, terms like **"face-to-face,"** **"physically present,"** or** "on-site"** are often used.
## Why In Person Therapy Can Work Better

[According to WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/online-mental-health-therapy-what-to-know), "Some people benefit more from in-person sessions. In online therapy, you lose aspects of nonverbal communication, like body language. These unspoken signals, like a tapping foot or fidgety hand, can help a therapist understand your overall mood."

When you meet with your therapist in person, they can see your whole body, not just your face on a screen. They notice when you cross your arms, tap your foot, or slouch in your chair. These small actions tell your therapist a lot about how you're really feeling, even when your words say something different.

[Psychology Today notes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/what-works-best-online-or-in-person-therapy) that "Therapists seem to think in-person therapy is slightly better than teletherapy, but if the trade-off is therapy vs. no therapy, then teletherapy is a much better course of action." This shows that while both types of therapy work, many professionals still see special value in meeting in person.
### Sarah's Story: When In Person Made the Difference

Sarah had been doing online therapy for six months. She liked her therapist and felt comfortable talking on video calls. But something was missing. "I felt like I was holding back," Sarah says. "It was too easy to just close the laptop when things got hard."



When Sarah switched to in person sessions, everything changed. "Being in that office, with my therapist right there, made me feel safer to talk about the really difficult stuff. I couldn't just click 'leave meeting' when I got uncomfortable. My therapist could see when I was getting upset and helped me work through it right away."

Sarah's experience shows how in person therapy can create a stronger sense of commitment and connection. When you have to travel to your appointment and sit in the same room as your therapist, it feels more real and important.
## The Science Behind In Person Connections

Research shows that people connect better when they're in the same physical space. When you're in person with someone, your brain releases hormones that help you feel closer and more trusting. This is harder to achieve when you're looking at a screen.

In person therapy also helps your nervous system feel calm. Your office visits become a routine that your brain recognizes as a safe, healing time. Walking into your therapist's office signals to your mind: "This is where I work on myself."
## What You Get from In Person Therapy That You Can't Get Online

Better Focus: When you're in your therapist's office, there are no distractions. No pets jumping on your lap, no family members walking by, no work emails popping up on your screen. You can give your full attention to your mental health.

Stronger Safety: Some people worry about privacy when doing therapy from hom

e. What if someone overhears? What if the video call isn't secure? In person therapy happens in a private, professional space designed just for healing.

Full Communication: Your therapist can see everything - how you sit, how you breathe, how you move your hands when you talk. This helps them understand you better and give you more helpful support.

Real Rituals: The act of traveling to therapy, sitting in the waiting room, and walking into your therapist's office creates a mental shift. It tells your brain: "This is an important time for me."
### **In Person vs Online Therapy Comparison**

When choosing between in person and online therapy, it helps to see them side by side.

Here's how they compare across the most important factors:


### Additional Research Shows In Person Session Works

The numbers don’t lie.

Therapy works, and many people are turning to it for support. Since 2020, about 30% of American adults have seen a therapist, and in 2021 alone, around 42 million people received mental health treatment or counseling.

When it comes to outcomes, the research is encouraging. One major study found that 67.98% of people improved with therapy, 33.83% showed significant improvement, and 34.15% showed some progress. The dropout rate was just 18.76%, meaning most people stick with therapy once they find the right fit.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), one of the most common approaches used in both in-person and virtual therapy, shows success rates between 50% and 75% for issues like anxiety, depression, and phobias.

## Mental Conditions That Benefit Most from In Person Sessions

Certain mental health conditions respond better to in person treatment.

Here are the main ones where meeting face-to-face often makes a bigger difference:

PTSD and Trauma Disorders: When you've experienced trauma, your nervous system is often on high alert. Being in a safe, consistent physical space with your therapist helps your brain learn that you're truly safe. In person therapy allows therapists to use body-based techniques that help process trauma stored in your body.

Severe Depression: When depression is severe, it can be hard to feel connected to anything or anyone. The physical presence of your therapist during [depression therapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/depression-therapy/) can provide a lifeline when you feel completely alone. It's also easier for therapists to assess suicide risk when they can see you in person.

Eating Disorders: Recovery from eating disorders often involves changing your relationship with your body. [In person therapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/therapy/in-person-therapy-orlando/) lets therapists observe eating behaviors, body language, and physical signs that might indicate relapse or progress.

Severe Anxiety and Panic Disorders: Panic attacks can feel terrifying, especially when you're alone at home. Having your therapist physically present during anxiety episodes can provide immediate grounding and safety. They can guide you through breathing exercises and calming techniques more effectively.

Autism Spectrum Disorders: Many people with autism benefit from the structure and routine of in person appointments. The consistent environment helps reduce anxiety, and therapists can better observe and work with sensory needs.

Personality Disorders: Building trust and healthy relationships is often a key part of treating personality disorders. The deeper connection possible through in person therapy can be crucial for healing relationship patterns.

Substance Use Disorders: Accountability is important in addiction recovery. In person sessions make it harder to avoid appointments and easier for therapists to notice signs of relapse.

### **What Therapists Say About In Person Sessions**

Mental health professionals have strong opinions about the value of face-to-face therapy. Dr. Robert Glenn, a licensed clinical psychologist in Orlando, explains: "There's an energy exchange that happens when you're physically present with someone that you just can't replicate through a screen. I can sense my client's nervous system state much more accurately when they're sitting across from me."

Licensed therapist Karla Mcleod notes: "In my 8 years of practice, I've seen how the ritual of coming to therapy like the drive, the waiting room, the transition into my office, actually helps people shift into therapeutic mode. It's harder to achieve that mental shift when you're logging in from your kitchen table."
### The Home Environment Challenge

Your home is full of distractions, even when you don't realize it. During online therapy, part of your brain might be thinking about the dishes in the sink, the laundry that needs folding, or the work deadline you're stressed about.

When you go to your therapist's office for in person sessions, you leave all those distractions behind. The only thing you need to focus on is your mental health. This can make your therapy time much more effective.
### Building Trust Through In Person Connection

Trust is the most important part of therapy. You need to feel safe with your therapist before you can share your deepest thoughts and feelings. While you can build trust online, it often happens faster in person.

When you're in the same room as your therapist, you can see their full reactions. You notice their body language, their facial expressions, and their energy. This helps you feel more confident that they truly care about helping you.

In person meetings also feel more "real" to many people. It's easier to believe that your therapist is fully present and focused on you when they're sitting across from you, rather than appearing as a face on a screen that could be distracted by other things.
## In Person: Making the Right Choice for You

The best therapy is the therapy you actually do. If online sessions work well for you and you're making progress, that's great! But if you've been struggling with [virtual therapy](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/virtual-counseling/) or feeling like something is missing, it might be time to try in person sessions.

Think about these questions:

 	Do you find it hard to focus during online sessions?
 	Do you feel like you're holding back or not fully opening up?
 	Are you dealing with trauma or crisis situations?
 	Do you miss the human connection of being in the same room as someone?
 	Are distractions at home making it hard to get the most out of therapy?

### When In Person Therapy Is Especially Helpful

Beyond specific mental health conditions, some situations make in person therapy particularly valuable:

 	When you're in crisis: If you're having thoughts of hurting yourself or others, being physically present with a trained professional provides an extra layer of safety.
 	If you have trouble focusing at home: Many people find it hard to concentrate during online sessions because of distractions in their environment.
 	If you're not comfortable with technology: Some people feel awkward on video calls or worry about technical problems interrupting important conversations.

If you answered yes to any of these, in person therapy might be a better fit for you.
## Showing Up In Person: The Bottom Line

In person therapy offers something special that's hard to replicate online. The full connection, better communication, and distraction-free environment can make a real difference in your healing journey.

Both in person and online therapy can be effective. The most important thing is finding what works best for you. If you've been wondering whether to try in person sessions, it might be worth having a conversation with your [Orlando therapist](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/) about your options.

Your mental health deserves the best care possible. Whether that's in person, online, or a combination of both, the key is taking that first step to get the support you need. You're worth the investment in your wellbeing.
