## Understanding Anxiety in the Workplace

Anxiety is one of the most common mental health challenges in the workplace, affecting nearly 20% of adults annually, according to the [Anxiety & Depression Association of America](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/facts-statistics) (ADAA).

[ADAA survey](https://adaa.org/workplace-stress-anxiety-disorders-survey) also shows that 56% of employees report anxiety impacts their performance. Some work situations can feel especially stressful or hard to handle for individuals managing anxiety. People with anxiety are highly sensitive to stress, which can trigger panic attacks or, in more severe cases, lead to mental breakdowns.

To find jobs for people with anxiety, it’s important to know what might trigger anxiety and which types of jobs could make it worse.
### Common Anxiety Triggers at Work


 	High-pressure environments: Jobs with intense deadlines or constant multitasking can feel overwhelming.
