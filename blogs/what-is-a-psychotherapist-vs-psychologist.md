When embarking on a journey to better mental health, it’s crucial to understand the roles of different mental health professionals. Two common types are psychotherapists and psychologists. Though they may seem similar, their training, qualifications and approaches to treatment can differ. 

Understanding the differences between psychotherapists and psychologists can help you make the right choices for treatment and get the help you need to manage your mental health. 

##  
## What is a Psychotherapist?
A psychotherapist is a term that encompasses professionals with a unique set of skills who are trained to treat mental health disorders through talk therapy. These professionals come from various educational backgrounds, including psychology, psychiatry and counseling. 

They use a range of therapeutic approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic Therapy, to help individuals manage and overcome mental health issues like [anxiety](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/anxiety-treatment/), [depression ](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/depression-treatment/)and [Bipolar Disorder](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/treatments/bipolar-disorder-treatment/). They work in different settings, such as private practices, hospitals and mental health clinics.

##  
## What is a Psychologist?
A psychologist is a mental health professional who holds a doctorate degree in psychology. They are extensively trained in the study of the mind and behavior and are equipped to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychologists are trained to provide psychotherapy and also conduct psychological testing and research.

They treat a wide range of issues, including depression and trauma and may focus on a specific area of study, such as [counseling psychology](https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/counseling). They work in various settings, such as private practices, hospitals, schools and research institutions.

## Differences Between Psychotherapists and Psychologists
While both psychotherapists and psychologists are dedicated to improving mental health, there are several key differences. The following explains these distinctions and how they impact the type and depth of care you can receive:

## Psychiatrists: A Related Profession
Psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialize in mental health. Unlike psychotherapists and psychologists, [psychiatrists hold a medical degree](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/team/) and can prescribe medications. They often work alongside these professionals to provide comprehensive care for mental health conditions. 

Their focus is on diagnosing mental illnesses, managing medications and providing medical treatments.

## Choosing the Right Professional for Your Needs
Deciding between a psychotherapist and a psychologist depends on your specific needs and the type of therapy you are seeking. If you require a comprehensive assessment, diagnosis and treatment of a mental health disorder, a psychologist may be the right choice. However, if you are looking for talk therapy to manage specific life circumstances or emotional issues, a psychotherapist might be more suitable.
