How do we define short term in a relationship? According to relationship experts and psychologists, a short term relationship is a romantic connection that typically lasts from a few weeks to several months.



Sarah stared at her phone. The text message made her heart race: "I really like you, but I'm only looking for something short term right now."

In that moment, her heart sank. Was it just an excuse... *or was he telling the truth?*

What did that even mean? Was he just trying to let her down easy? Or was this actually a real type of relationship?

If you’ve ever stood at the edge of something that felt real but wasn’t meant to last — you’re not alone.

Every day, **millions fall into casual dating**, thinking they understand the rules... until feelings change, and someone walks away.

**What is**** a short term relationship**, really? And why does it feel so real? Let’s understand its key dynamics.
## **What is a Short Term Relationship?**

Coming from the word “Short term,” it means something that’s not built to last forever. It’s a connection with an expiration date — even if the feelings don’t come with one.

A short term relationship is a romantic connection between two people that lasts for a brief period, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months. ***Unlike long-term commitments***, these relationships have a clear understanding that they won't lead to marriage or lifelong partnership.

How we define **short** depends on the people involved, but usually, it means the relationship lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. It’s long enough to fall for someone’s smile, to share late-night talks, to miss them before they’re even gone — but not long enough to build a future together.

Think of it like renting an apartment instead of buying a house. You enjoy the experience while it lasts, but you both know it's temporary from the start. There’s often emotional closeness, real moments, and maybe even love. But there’s also a quiet understanding, spoken or not: this will end.

It’s not a mistake. **It’s a choice.**


### What is a Short Term Relationship Called?

Short term relationships go by several names:

 	Casual dating (though this can be less committed)
 	Situationship (when the boundaries are unclear)
 	Short term dating
 	Temporary relationship
 	Transitional relationship

## Short Term Dating: The Usual Timeline

The duration of Short term relationships varies, but most experts agree on these timeframes:

Typical Duration:

 	2 weeks to 6 months
 	Average length: 2-3 months
 	Some can extend up to 8 months

*"According to [UC Davis relationship research,](https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/long-term-and-short-term-relationships-initially-indistinguishable) temporary relationships that last beyond 6 months often transition into something more serious or end naturally as people realize their incompatibility."*
The timeline **depends on several factors**:

 	How often you see each other.
 	The intensity of your connection.
 	Your personal circumstances.
 	Whether feelings develop unexpectedly.

### What Is Considered a Short Term Relationship?

If it’s a relationship that lasts anywhere from a few weeks to about 6 months. Some might stretch to 8 months, but beyond that, it often begins to shift — either toward something more serious or a natural ending.

Important Note: It’s not just about the number of days,  it’s about the intention behind the connection. These relationships are understood to be temporary from the start, with both people aware that it’s not building toward a long-term future.

## Key Characteristics of Short Term Relationships

### 1. Clear Time-Bound Expectations

Both people understand the relationship has an expiration date. This might be because:

 	Someone is moving away for work or school
 	One person isn't ready for a serious commitment
 	Both are exploring what they want in a partner
 	Life circumstances make long-term planning impossible

### 2. Emotional Connection Without Deep Commitment

Short term relationships involve real feelings. You care about each other, enjoy spending time together, and may even fall in love. However, you don't make major life decisions based on this relationship.
### 3. Limited Future Planning

You might plan next weekend's activities, but you're not discussing where to spend Christmas two years from now. The focus stays on the present moment.
### 4. Open Communication About Boundaries

Successful casual dating requires honest conversations about expectations, other courting, and what happens when it ends.
## What is an Example of a Short Term Relationship?

### Example 1: The Summer Romance.

Jessica, a college student, met Mark during her summer internship in another city. They both knew she'd return to school in August. For three months, they dated exclusively, attended events together, and developed genuine feelings. When summer ended, they had a loving goodbye and remained friends.
### Example 2: The Rebound Relationship.

After a difficult divorce, Tom wasn't ready for a serious commitment. He met Lisa, who understood his situation. They dated for four months, providing each other companionship and emotional support while Tom healed. When Tom felt ready to date seriously again, they ended things amicably.
### Example 3: The Career-Focused Connection.

Maya was preparing for medical school applications and knew she'd be too busy for a serious relationship. She met David, who was also career-focused. They enjoyed each other's company for five months while supporting each other's goals, then naturally grew apart as their schedules intensified.

## What Does it Mean if Someone Wants a Short Term Relationship?

When someone says they want a short term relationship, they're usually communicating one of these messages:

 	Practice relationship skills
 	Experience different types of connections

People call Short term love different names. Some common ones are:

 	Temporary love – Love that lasts only for a little while.

 	Short term attachment – A close bond that forms quickly but doesn't last long.

## Short Term Dating vs Hookup: What's the Difference?

Many people confuse Short term dating with casual hookups, but they're quite different:

Short term dating includes:

 	Regular communication
 	Going on actual dates
 	Some level of exclusivity (often discussed)
 	Emotional connection
 	Getting to know each other as people

Hookups typically involve:

 	Minimal emotional investment
 	Infrequent communication
 	No expectation of ongoing dating

## Benefits of Short Term Relationships

Short term relationships aren't consolation prizes. They offer unique advantages like:

 	Personal Growth - You learn about yourself without the pressure of "making it work forever."
 	Skill Development - You practice communication, compromise, and intimacy skills.
 	Reduced Pressure - Without long-term expectations, you can be more authentic and relaxed.
 	Emotional Support - You get companionship during specific life phases when you need it most.

## Temporary Relationship Potential Challenges

Casual dating isn't without difficulties. While they can be rewarding, they can also bring unexpected pain.
### Developing Unexpected Feelings

Even if both people agree on the rules from the start, emotions don’t always follow them. You can set clear boundaries — and still fall madly in love. When that happens, the ending can hurt deeply, leaving one person holding feelings with nowhere to place them.

If you're struggling with letting go, this[ article on how to get over someone and move on with your life](https://empathyhealthclinic.com/how-to-get-over-someone-and-move-on-with-your-life/) offers helpful, compassionate steps to begin healing.
### Unclear Boundaries

Without open and honest communication, it’s easy for one or both people to get confused. What started as “just for now” can turn into mixed signals and unmet expectations.
### Social Judgment

Not everyone understands or supports short term dating. You might face comments or pressure from friends, family, or even yourself.
### Timing Issues

Sometimes one person is ready for more, and the other isn’t. That gap in readiness can create tension, disappointment, or an emotional imbalance.

***“Short term relationships offer clarity and emotional growth without the pressure of forever,”** *says **Rachel Coalburn,** intimacy therapist and relationship researcher at Empathy Health Clinic.

## Why Do People Agree to Short Term Relationships?

At first glance, situationship might seem like emotional landmines — full of potential heartbreak, confusion, or regret. So why do so many people still say yes to something they know won’t last?

The answer isn’t simple, but it is deeply human.
### 1. The Timing Feels Right — Even If the Future Doesn’t

Sometimes, people meet at the wrong time but still feel a strong connection. Maybe one person is moving cities. Maybe they're healing from a breakup. Maybe their careers don’t leave room for commitment. And yet... the chemistry is undeniable.

Rather than walk away from something real, they choose to enjoy the moment — even if it comes with an expiration date.
### 2. Emotional Connection Still Matters, Even Temporarily

People crave connection. Even knowing it won’t last forever, the comfort of someone’s arms, late-night talks, and shared laughter can make a big difference during lonely or transitional phases in life.

In those moments, the now feels more important than the later.
### 3. It’s a Way to Heal or Rebuild Confidence

For those recovering from heartbreak or loss, short term relationships can be gentle stepping stones. They help people feel desired again, reconnect with romance, or learn to trust themselves emotionally, without the overwhelming pressure of a long-term future.

It’s not about avoiding love. It’s about learning to feel safe in it again.
### 4. Curiosity and Self-Discovery

Many people agree to situationship simply because they’re figuring out what they want. These relationships can be part of exploring preferences, values, and boundaries. For some, they’re just as educational as they are emotional.
### 5. Freedom Without Complete Isolation

A short term commitment offers companionship and intimacy, without tying someone down long-term. For individuals prioritizing career, travel, personal growth, or healing, it’s a way to experience closeness without derailing their life plans.
### The Quiet Truth

Even when people agree to a short term relationship, they know the risks. They know feelings can grow, that endings hurt, and that saying goodbye to someone you shared part of your heart with is never easy.

But they also know that not every relationship is meant to last forever.

*Some are meant to teach.
Some are meant to heal.
Some are just meant to be — for a while.*

**And that’s okay.**

Short term relationships may not promise forever, but they often give people exactly what they need for now.
## Making Short Term Relationships Work

If you're thinking about trying short term dating and believe it could be meaningful, there are a few things you should know first.

To make it work well, success depends on:

 	Honest Communication. Be upfront about your expectations and limitations from the beginning.
 	Clear Boundaries. Discuss exclusivity, communication frequency, and what happens if feelings change.
 	Present-Moment Focus. Enjoy what you have now instead of constantly wondering "what if."
 	Respectful Endings. Plan for how you'll handle the transition when the relationship runs its course.
