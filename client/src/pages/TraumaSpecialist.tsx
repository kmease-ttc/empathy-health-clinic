              question: "What is a trauma specialist?",
              answer: "A trauma specialist is a mental health professional with specialized training in treating trauma-related conditions like PTSD, complex trauma, childhood trauma, and acute stress. They use evidence-based therapies such as EMDR, trauma-focused CBT, and other proven approaches to help you heal from traumatic experiences."
            },
            {
              question: "What types of trauma can you treat?",
              answer: "We treat all types of trauma including childhood abuse or neglect, sexual assault, domestic violence, accidents or injuries, combat trauma, grief and loss, medical trauma, natural disasters, and witnessing violence. Our trauma specialists are trained in multiple evidence-based approaches."
            },
            {
              question: "How is trauma therapy different from regular therapy?",
              answer: "Trauma therapy uses specialized techniques designed specifically to help process traumatic memories and reduce their emotional impact. Unlike general talk therapy, trauma-focused approaches like EMDR and trauma-focused CBT target the way traumatic memories are stored in the brain, helping you heal without having to relive the trauma in detail."
            },
            {
              question: "Do I need to talk about my trauma in detail?",
              answer: "No. Many trauma therapies, especially EMDR, don't require you to discuss your trauma in extensive detail. Your trauma specialist will work at your pace and use techniques that allow your brain to process the trauma naturally, without forcing you to relive painful experiences."
            },
            {
              question: "What if I'm not sure if I have trauma?",
              answer: "Many people don't realize they have trauma. Signs include intrusive memories, nightmares, avoidance of reminders, emotional numbness, hypervigilance, or difficulty trusting others. During your initial evaluation, our trauma specialists can help identify if trauma is contributing to your current symptoms."
