const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What causes PTSD?",
    answer: "PTSD can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event such as combat, assault, accidents, natural disasters, or other life-threatening situations. Not everyone who experiences trauma develops PTSD—factors like the severity of the event, personal history, and available support all play a role."
  },
  {
    question: "How long after a trauma can PTSD develop?",
    answer: "PTSD symptoms typically begin within 3 months of the traumatic event, but they can sometimes appear years later. Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with daily life to be diagnosed as PTSD."
  },
  {
    question: "What is EMDR therapy and how does it work?",
    answer: "EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a therapy that uses bilateral stimulation (typically eye movements) while you recall traumatic memories. This helps the brain process the trauma differently, reducing the emotional intensity of the memories. It's been extensively researched and is highly effective for PTSD."
  },
  {
    question: "What medications help with PTSD?",
    answer: "SSRIs like sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil) are FDA-approved for PTSD and can help with depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Prazosin is often used for trauma-related nightmares. Your psychiatrist will recommend medications based on your specific symptoms."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does PTSD treatment take?",
    answer: "Treatment duration varies, but many people see significant improvement within 12-16 weeks of trauma-focused therapy. Some patients benefit from longer-term treatment, especially for complex trauma. Our goal is lasting recovery, not just symptom management."
  },
  {
    question: "Can PTSD be cured?",
    answer: "While 'cure' may not be the right term, PTSD is highly treatable. Many people recover fully and no longer meet criteria for PTSD after treatment. Others learn to manage symptoms effectively and live fulfilling lives. Early treatment generally leads to better outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you treat veterans with PTSD?",
    answer: "Yes, we have experience treating veterans and active-duty military personnel with combat-related PTSD. We understand the unique challenges of military trauma and provide a safe, supportive environment for healing."

                Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. While it's normal to have difficulty coping after trauma, PTSD involves symptoms that persist for months or years and significantly interfere with daily life.

                PTSD can affect anyone—veterans, survivors of assault, accident victims, first responders, and others who have experienced trauma. The good news is that PTSD is treatable, and most people who receive proper care experience significant improvement.
