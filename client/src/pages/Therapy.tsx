Whether you're facing a specific challenge like <Link href="/anxiety-disorders" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">anxiety</Link> or <Link href="/depression" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">depression</Link>, navigating a major life transition, or simply seeking personal growth, therapy offers powerful tools for understanding yourself better and creating lasting positive change.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-sans font-semibold text-foreground mb-4 mt-8">How Does Therapy Work?</h3>
            
            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Therapy begins with an initial assessment where you'll meet with your therapist to discuss your concerns, goals, and what you hope to achieve through treatment. Together, you'll develop a personalized treatment plan that outlines the therapeutic approach and frequency of sessions. Most clients attend weekly or bi-weekly sessions, though this can be adjusted based on your needs and progress.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              During therapy sessions, you'll work collaboratively with your therapist to identify patterns in your thoughts and behaviors, develop healthier coping strategies, process difficult emotions, and build skills for managing life's challenges. Therapy isn't about giving advice or telling you what to do—instead, it's about helping you discover your own insights, strengths, and solutions while providing professional guidance and support along the way.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">

Many therapists integrate multiple therapeutic techniques to create a personalized treatment approach that addresses your unique needs. Our priority is ensuring you receive the most effective care possible, whether that's through individual therapy, couples counseling, or a combination of therapeutic interventions paired with <Link href="/medication-management" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">medication management</Link> when appropriate.
