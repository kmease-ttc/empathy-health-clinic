                  Depression is more than just feeling sad - it's a serious medical condition that affects how you think, feel, and function. At Empathy Health Clinic, we understand that depression looks different for everyone, and we tailor our treatment approach to your unique needs.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                  Depression can be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Life events like trauma, loss, or chronic stress can trigger depression, as can medical conditions and certain medications. The good news is that depression is highly treatable - most people who seek help experience significant improvement.
